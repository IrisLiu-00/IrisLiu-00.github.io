# Synopsis

Change comes slow to the Ravage, and never without a cost.

As the Voltiss Railroad Company drives its spikes across a land of wind-blasted canyons and haunted stone, workers have unearthed trouble deep below ground: a monstrous fossil, one of many legendary beasts driven to extinction but still wrathful in their death. You are a team of exorcists sent by the Synchordant Orthodoxy, blessed fighters and magicians with the ability to put down the haunted corpse of a monster. But trouble brews beyond the reach of the Orthodoxy, and this job may turn out more difficult than it first seems...

# Lore

### The Ravage
- Wasteland of basalt canyons, ashy soil, black glass slicks
- Produced by some ancient cataclysm millennia ago
- Fossils of monsters preserved between layers of lava - haunted by the souls of dead beasts, volatile
### Synchordant Orthodoxy
- Synchord: divine power that is the source of all magic. All magic wielders derive their ability from this source.
- Conceptualizes the Synchord as a divinely-ordained order of nature, acting in opposition to corruption 
	- corruption manifests in the fossils. Subversion of reality
- Includes priests who study the Synchord, warriors who enforce order, as well as natural philosophers who study fossils + geology in an attempt to understand the Cataclysm and how to control its remnants 

Reconstruction
- Certain fossils can be harnessed for the beast's power, but others are deemed too dangerous and must be exorcised
- Exorcism is a synchordant ritual, combining two volatile elements to form a stable whole. The energy of the reaction exorcises and destroys the beast and its bones
	- holy water: hydrochloric acid, stored in magically stabilized iron flasks? or glass with iron inlays
		- runes to direct the reaction in a magic circle
	- arrange holy water in a pentagram, wires connecting, sodium placed at the stopper of the flasks
	- electric impluse on the wire > electrolysis of HCL produces chlorine gas (and hydrogen gas?!) > react with sodium in bright red flame
		- chlorine gas = pellets + hcl, or electrolysis of potassium chloride
	- sodium explodes in water - underground river
	- place devices, then spellcasting to initiate (x spell attacks to succeed)? chain the beast in place?
		- minions harrass/steal the flasks
		- give them the chalk/iron filing diagram already drawn out - repurpose the reconstruction?
	- give players an exorcist's pack
- Reconstruction - resurrects the soul and ties it to the fossils. a shadow of the beast and its power
	- requires accurate anatomical knowledge of the beast
## Voltiss Railroad Company
- vampires? not tolerated by Orthodoxy
- Carmine Voltiss

Sunrise paints the sky the color of rust, bleeding out across the Ravage. The land, shades of black and gray - savage canyons of basalt, ashy soil dotted by scrubland. Every few leagues, a merciless slick of black glass which reflects the sky in monochrome. 

Fossil: halo, like all greater fossils. Not a glow of light a lensing of light around it, a warp in space. Like it is either more or less real than its surroundings. 
- lair effects
- lindwyrm: cave dwelling dragon, acid breath to dissolve stone. comes up on land to hunt. hibernate in winter. 
	- shed skin to shed status effects/spells
	- twist - they're pair bonded, there are two of them?
