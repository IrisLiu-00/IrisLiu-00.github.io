Backstory
- mother died young, father involved in shady stuff
	- daddy issues
Basically like a kallista convinced girl to cut class with her and brought her to a shady market, they got pickpocketed and kallista was like nah fuck it letâ€™s get your shit back, they went after the pickpocketers but she ended up getting stabbed by them
And like it was kallistas knife bc they got pickpocketed or something and kallistas finger prints on body bc and she was like fuckkkk so she freaked out and ran or something of that nature
I was thinking something like the family of the girl thought kallista was bad news from the start bc she was a hooligan and claimed it was a kallista kill attempt
This might be too deep into your world building but a maybe the girl was the  daughter of a politician and they extra used it as an excuse to be really tough on crime and misbehavior etc etc
And popo were like kallista killed her and stole her shit bc she was a well off politician daughter idk
