# The Fray

- Supernatural phenomenon at the center of the sea
- An arcane vacuum / a hole in the Weave created by the Cataclysm
	- No magic under its influence
	- Fray and its wraiths hunger for magic to fill a void
- Ocean water turns milky white, sublimating into bright white fog
- Storm, stillwater, lightning. Navigation systems fail
- Fray-wraiths: those who died to original Cataclysm and later to the Fray
- Breathing in fog is bad (what effects?)
	- memory loss, auto cannibalism?
- Circular waterfall at center (a mouth) - goddess in the center
