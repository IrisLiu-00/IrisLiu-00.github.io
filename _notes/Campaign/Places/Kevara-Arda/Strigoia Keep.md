art pieces in the keep have been perverted to mimics

  

Exterior

- Outer walls: 40 feet high, 10 feet wide, 4 watchtowers
    - Crossbows mounted around (DC14 dex save, 2d4 piercing)
    - how many guards
    - Main gate (2 layers)
    - Back gate: heavy padlock (DC 18), guards on wall can see down
- Fort walls: bows only reach within the outer walls, courtyard
    - Hand bows (DC14 dex save, 1d6 piercing)

  

First floor

- Main entrance: head butler will check against guestlist, posted guards
- Side entrances: locked (DC14), roaming guards
- Windows, doors are alarmed against people not on the whitelist
    - Rune at doorways can only be pressed by Ornsgrym, head of guard to let in guests
    - Disable alarm system in cellar
    - Whitelist already inscribed with names of guests + servants carried by head guard
- Great hall: ballroom, long table at head for dining, band, open area for dancing / entertainment
    - most of the guests are here, musicians, a lot of guards + serving staff
    - Balcony: self playing piano and violin cast [sleep](https://5e.tools/spells.html#sleep_phb) ; if attacked/touched, DC11 con save for 2d8 psychic damage
        - instruments brought by one of the elven guests
- Solarium, smoking room: some guests also sitting here talking
- Prep room: dumbwaiter, stairs down to basement + up to second floor
    - Servants prepping dishes to send into hall
    - Servants passage to cloakroom
    - Dumbwaiter can carry a small person, food, laundry
- Foyer + halls: paintings, marble statues, fine ceramics, wooden masks
    - Large standing vases are mimics (investigation to discern)
    - Percp check to notice no windows on one side of hall- servants passage entrance
- Dining: mostly empty, dumbwaiter
    - Servants passage to downstairs
    - servants clearing dishes
- Washroom: might be occupied
- Courtyard: petrified Strigoi, smaller gargoyles (stirges) perched on walkway columns
    - Runes, onyx cabochon carved on the base of the statue - mythal can only be activated/deactivated by the bloodline holding the keep (Ornsgrym)
- Servants passages: entries have glyphs of warding (DC 12 investigation to detect) against anyone who is not a servant
    - Disables if you are dressed in servant’s clothes
    - Spell effect: alarm the guards, passages+corridors fill with fog ([guards and wards](https://5e.tools/spells.html#guards%20and%20wards_phb), guards can see thru fog)

  

Second Floor

- Maids will be cleaning rooms upstairs
- Large atrium looking down on double staircase, great hall
- Prep room: dumbwaiter, servants passage?
- Bedrooms: mostly locked (DC 12), except for one where some guests are getting frisky
- Study: Ornsgrym’s wife - going through his correspondence, found out he’s cheating on her
    - “Oh Leanna, how I miss your touch! Every night I think of your golden tresses, the delicate points of your ear, your milk white skin. You have left me, I’m afraid, with a thirst that cannot be slaked by anything but your lips. When will you next visit Kevara?”

Vault

- Halfway up the watchtower, enter stairs thru Study
- Arcane lock only openable by Ornsgrym’s touch or passcode “rolandfort”
- Intruders entering saferoom pass through a staticky golden veil > triggers mythal
    - barrier at fortress walls blocks anything but air, strigoi animates, mimics + dead called to action
- Magically much larger inside, windowless, lit by light sigils
- Empty except for large mirror on opposite wall, which reflects room with all the art pieces inside - paintings hung on wall, statues of many sizes from jeweled miniatures to life size marble figures.
- Marble statues of beautiful women, all with their hands outstretched: a very pale elf with blond tresses (Leanna), a red haired human serving girl (Sadie), a slender blue dragonborn woman (Jasper)
    - Call by their name > named statue will turn to look at speaker, do the instruction (place something in vault, fetch something through the mirror)
- Many layered shelves filled with Ornsgrym’s fine art collection
    - Set of finely filigreed, golden tableware in a cedar box (worth a fortune if they get the full set)
    - Large, gem inlaid sculpture of a flowering dryad
    - Paintings: old portraits, still life of rotting fruit, large academic style painting of the founding of Kevara-Arda, warrior wrestling an owlbear, Selleward’s landscape of Kevara port
    - Haul 300-600 gp
- Guards on watchtower above might hear commotion

  

Basement

- Barracks for servants and guards
- Kitchen: very busy, manned by head cook and kitchen workers
    - Stairs from tomb lead into kitchen
- Control panel in cellar to disable alarms (on entryways, ongoing fog effects)

  

Crypt

- flooded entrance to escape tunnel to nearby town
- Tombs: warriors who died defending the keep, now Dread Warriors
    - Activate upon entrance? or on failed check

  

  

  

- arcane protections?
    - magic mouth
    - suggestion, tied to a location
    - triggers for guards alarms
    - series of sigils that cant be broken / defaced
    - something to track getaway
- impose a time limit to force them to split up
