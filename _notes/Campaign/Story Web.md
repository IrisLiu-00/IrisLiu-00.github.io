Open questions
- motivations of the Council to replace Fate
- how is the Council escaping its past - something bad happened bc of fate and the leader is unwilling to face up to it. related to elemental surges? trying to rewrite fate to cover up past mistake?
	- maybe the bad guy is a reincarnation/sth of someone from the cataclysm? forcing the world to face its past
- how is Kevara escaping its past
- how to tie elemental magic into the web - remnants of the before?
- cosmology of apostasy wrt the cataclysm, Fate

relation to wild surge elemental magic - remnants of the before?
why is the council encroaching on Kevara? What do they achieve by Luca gaining power? has to do with Kevar and Arda, something in the catacombs (too similar to labyrinth)?
