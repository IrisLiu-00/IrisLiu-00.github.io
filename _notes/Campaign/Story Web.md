Open questions
- ==motivations of the Council to replace Fate
	- how is the Council escaping its past - something bad happened bc of fate and the leader is unwilling to face up to it. related to elemental surges? trying to rewrite fate to cover up past mistake?
	- maybe the bad guy is a reincarnation/sth of someone from the cataclysm? forcing the world to face its past
- how to tie elemental magic into the web - remnants of the before?
- cosmology of apostasy wrt the cataclysm, Fate


Central tensions

	- the Council
	- Vasilev and her past
	- Kevara-Arda was founded on a great wrong - something that Kevar/Arda did 
		- stolen land? from the culture now in avizallo

			- caused instability in Langska, led to rise of first emperor

The fate of Kevara-Arda - political struggle, natural/arcane threats
The Cursed Ocean
Konrad Luca - capitalist
- puppet of the council
- 
Council - cultists, megalomaniacs
- want to kill the goddess of fate, create a new engine to run the universe upon - the rules and constraints of the universe, destiny
- they know abt the first engine, do they know abt the cataclysm?
- powerful men who control society, but want to control more. they think they're doing it for the good of everyone
	- order vs freedom
	- automata as perfectly predictable + controlled systems. Both the perfect citizen and the tool to control (surveil) citizens
- Based in Kevara (where?)
- hold positions in Avizallo court, Langksa, trying to use Luca to gain Kevara-Arda
- sponsoring grave robbers to find fate engine piece in Kevara, also the Felechian cult?
- experimenting on fray-tides because they know it's related to the first engine
- steps to power
	- find ancient artificer's lab on how to create advanced automata
	- find pieces of the last fate engine: in apostasy, under Kevara Arda (was used by founders somehow), in mirwood related to green man/eaten by sky whale(?)
ancient Artificer
Labyrinth (nexida)
- an automata that was uncontrollable, unpredictable - agent of chaos
Felichias: goddess of fate
- Controls the things that happen by chance - the flip of a coin, the tumbling of a particle of air
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,
- Intent, desires? force of nature or willful human?
- Manages the engine (abacus? comptroller?) of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
- the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm (Felicia Brown)

latest fad in the city is eating the memories of the dead
- can be a narcotic, forgetting your own past by living in the past of others
- graverobbers loot all the historical sites
- Vasilev is amassing a personal collection of dead pieces to resurrect as ghosts for voting
