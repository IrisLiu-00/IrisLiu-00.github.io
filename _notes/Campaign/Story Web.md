  

why is the ocean fucked up? haunted by souls of the cataclysm

lacunian sea, ravening sea, the still, the ___ fray

storm, stillwater, lightning, fog, white light

goddess = soul of lady + dead ppl

a living thing, a circular mouth waterfall in the center - hungry for the magic in living things

breathing in the fog causes forgetting, then auto cannibalism to feed the sea. wraiths = ppl who died in the original cataclysm and ppl who died to the sea

they discovered magic and tried to use it to control fate > cataclysm cut a rift in the weave, formed the magic-less area of the sea. guards the goddess in the center

relation to wild surge elemental magic - remnants of the before?

winds blow the fog inland > mental effects, wraiths come, magic stops working

cosmology of apostasy - opposing force to divine?

where do elemental powers come from

why is the council encroaching on Kevara? What do they achieve by Luca gaining power? has to do with Kevar and Arda, something in the catacombs (too similar to labyrinth)?

central philosophy of the bbeg?

The fate of Kevara-Arda - political struggle, natural/arcane threats

The Cursed Ocean

Konrad Luca - capitalist

- puppet of the council

Council - cultists, megalomaniacs

- want to kill the goddess of fate, create a new engine to run the universe upon - the rules and constraints of the universe, destiny
- unbeknownst to them, they are replicating the first cataclysm
- leader’s home was Toby’s home, destroyed by Toby - thinks it was a freak accident? but this is weak bc if they find out it was not a result of fate
- central philosophy??
- order vs freedom, automation vs heritage

ancient Artificer

Labyrinth (nexida, miyuan)

Goddess of Fate (Mary Walker)

- Controls the things that happen by chance - the flip of a coin, the tumbling of a particle of air
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,
- Intent, desires? force of nature or willful human?
- Manages the engine (abacus? comptroller?) of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
- the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm
