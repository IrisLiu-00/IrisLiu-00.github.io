Need to set up
- Lore around Kevar, Arda, Gilead
- Role of Felichian religion, the goddess
- Coriolis's exploits
- Legends about dragons? 
- Patrician can't be killed - needs reminding beat
- the cataclysm

Central tensions: what do we owe the past vs the future. presence or lack of control.

What does everyone WANT
- Bluemoon: prove himself
- Kallista: escape her past
- Eletha: escape her past / confront her parents
- Toby: find his dad
- Lumdas: learn about the gods / resolve his past

Kallista
- Apostasy
	- ==philosophy? why are they focused on law, justice
		- not necessarily about law - moreso judgement, punishment, justice?
	- probably there is a bad guy associated w the council here, trying to get hold of the condenser - the opposing lawyer? (karuma)
	- bad guy faction: celestials trying to destroy apostasy? separatist devils who want to close off from material plane / merge + invade the material plane?
- Dead friend
	- murder was orchestrated by someone working for BBEG, wants Kallista convicted to cover up the trail
- Criminal background + connections, assassinations + thefts
    - took jobs from the Council
- Bard school

Bluemoon
- Hometown is Avizallo
- Vapor (genasi father)
    - Father died defending saltgrove workers from an attack (Fray?)
- Mother (humanlike air/earth genasi)
    - ancestor is Toby’s dad? air genasi parent purposefully tried to suppress child’s power
- Half elf teacher/aunt
    - Escapee from Moonflower labor camps
- Source of unpredictable power - bloodline, mixed lineage?
- Jeweler’s guild
    - multiclass into artificer? or he learns from Luca?
- Kristynne (ex lover)
    - Married a nobleman of Avizallo to gain power
    - Working against the bad guy in Avizallo
- Ring

Lumdas
- Mangurum - home village
    - was threatened by the thing from ocean?
    - sacrifice was actually to Onkeioros? ask Michael what biome the village is. edge of Mirwood? 
- Family + elders
- Earl Sweatshirt
- Goddess of Fate
	- a sect of the religion starts advocating a new world order - tied to the Council
	- give this guy some prophetic dreams or whatever
	- prophecy: will i ever find the truth about Felichias? 'go into the heart of the whiteness'

Toby
- Coriolis (Cory / Corin) - Djinn father, deadbeat dad
	- 95yrs ago, performed in Kevara (stole the Butcher's glory)
	- met tiefling and went to avizallo?
	- 90yrs ago, captured by the Artificer in Avizallo - artificer made a wish to create his labryinth in the sky
		- to capture a djinni: need a vessel sealed with the true name
	- was active in apostasy (doing what?) had a child (Indira Ashoor) with the evil lawyer
		- Indira was conceived as a vessel for djinni's powers - only a close blood relation of a djinni can hold a fraction of its powers
		- bad guys want air powers to get the Condenser (put out protective flames?) + chasing rumors of Nexida
		- transfer powers to someone else so they can use it to get to Nexida
	- later fell in love w Annalise, had Toby > left bc he's a deadbeat
	- (Kevara) performed again, (Avizallo) ran a gambling scheme to fix Kite battles, (Mirwood) ??
	- 2yrs ago, evil lawyer captured him again (how? for what crime?)
		- bad guy wished to transfer his powers to his child > Cory transferred to Toby > Indira ran away
	- now stripped of his power, inept. 
	- Prophecy: you will find him in the place of fire
- Mother (Annalise)
	- Once the Queen of Thieves in Kevara Arda
	- Hubris filled, worked for disciple of Gilead (either Owl, Lawyer, kevaran) to steal Nexida
	- why did she give up - she found Coriolis, found what Nexida was, fell in love?
	- Named after Annalise's friend Tobias? who is part of the Mirwood resistance
- Mysterious burst of wind power at 14yrs (2y ago) - from the power transfer
	- Coriolis has lost most of his memory, inept, deadbeat - need to build him up in order to pay off the disappointment
	- would need to establish the power transferral mechanic - maybe apostasy already uses it on fire elementals

Eletha
- Moonflower family + “philanthropy”
    - Ores mined are sold to Council, Luca Industries
- something in Mirwood points the way to the labyrinth
	- Onkeioros used the engine piece to do something before losing it - became corrupted?
- Shrewseer friend
- Monastery
    - part of the mirwood resistance
    - is felichian?

  

The fate of Kevara-Arda - political struggle, natural/arcane threats
The Fray
Konrad Luca - capitalist
- puppet of the synod
- Retro computing aesthetics: [dana siberia](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-cursed-universes-of-dana-sibera/)
Disciples of Gilead - come up with a cool codename
- Learned of the legends of the last engine of fate and want to replicate it
	- some want power and don't know it will destroy the world, some fate-stolen
- Led/controlled by Gilead, a lot of them are fate-stolen
	- maybe some of them were adventurers who got close to knowledge of the fate engine / gilead and were fate-stolen
	- were trying to create Indira as a sorcerer member, but she was defective and ran?
- Owl, apostasy lawyer, eletha's dad, Feldspar (descendant of Gilead)?
	- if Giltstern is a disciple then why have Luca run for office
	- give each member a distinct role
- steps to power
	- find ancient artificer's lab on how to create advanced automata
	- find pieces of the old fate engine
Gilead, the dragon king - The Big Bad
- figure out the motif/aesthetic
- gotta be cooler/sexier, gotta fall a little in love with your bad guy
- the fray tides are getting worse bc of Gilead's return
- eats people's fate - control over the fate engine will let them eat the fate of everyone + the world itself
	- what does it mean to lose your fate? 
	- a PC whose fate is eaten becomes a malicious NPC, an aspect of the fate eater
Luga Tensorat the Artificer 
- based in Avizallo
Labyrinth (nexida)
- an automata that was uncontrollable, unpredictable - agent of chaos
- floats just within the fray - carried by the trade winds around the sea
	- once a year it draws close to seaside cliffs - could access from here
- find his writings, maps, labs. need a special boat to get there? how to navigate thru Fray
- Tensorat made a wish using Coriolis to float his lab into the air, high above the Fray where none can reach
	- also wished that no one else could use Coriolis' power to access the labyrinth
- connection to djinn or genasi? enslaved air elementals to protect lab?? made a wish on Coriolis? so annalise was trying to get the location from coriolis?
	- you get a wish from a djinn by having them owe you a favor - or by trapping/tricking them
	- should it be a floating island
	- Bad guys might capture coriolis, or find some other way to find island
Elves
Onkeioros
Felichias: goddess of fate
- people think that fate is some omniscient force moving the paths of men - but it's really just senseless randomness
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,
- Intent, desires? force of nature or willful human?
- Manages the engine of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
	- the engine would have let you view + change the fate of an entity or an event. the BBEG would use that to change the fate of the world so it gets eaten
- the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm (Felicia Brown)
