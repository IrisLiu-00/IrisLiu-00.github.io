Open questions
- ==motivations of the Council to replace Fate, would be nice for the fate eater to tie into the central tension
	- how is the Council escaping its past - something bad happened bc of fate and the leader is unwilling to face up to it. related to elemental surges? trying to rewrite fate to cover up past mistake?
	- maybe the bad guy is a reincarnation/sth of someone from the cataclysm? forcing the world to face its past
- what are the pieces of the engine - need to thematically relate to each location
	- source of power (done), computational unit, I/O device, lens to divine potential possibilities, something to force a possibility, dice tower?, 
	- something that scans and draws out potential possibilities - divination, a gear of fortune?
	- something that augments your will, allows it to change reality
	- compass / navigational device to move between possibilities
	- a subtle knife - cuts things from their original fate
	- players might use the engine pieces to repair Felicia's engine instead
- how to tie elemental magic into the web - remnants of the before?
- cosmology of apostasy wrt the cataclysm, Fate


Central tensions
- running from the past
	- basically everyone's backstory
	- the world's reckoning with the past Cataclysm
	- the Council's disregard for the Cataclysm
	- the Council
	- Vasilev and her past
	- Kevara-Arda was founded on a great wrong - something that Kevar/Arda did 
		- stolen land? from the culture now in avizallo
		- reason for current inequality in the city?
		- acts as a bank - where did that seed money come from? invading/looting along the coast. Kevar+Arda were the first warlords
			- caused instability in Langska, led to rise of first emperor
- the forces of fate - what can/can't be controlled. what meaning do you make in a world that is inherently random, uncaring. 

  

Kallista
- Apostasy
	- ==philosophy? why are they focused on law, justice
		- not necessarily about law - moreso judgement, punishment, justice?
	- probably there is a bad guy associated w the council here, trying to get hold of the condenser
- Dead friend
- Criminal background + connections, assassinations + thefts
    - **in Kevara
    - took jobs from the Council
- Bard school
    - **in Kevara

Bluemoon
- Hometown is Avizallo
- Vapor (genasi father)
    - died fighting off Fray-wraith invasion
    - stronger Fray tides are because of council experimentation - trying to figure out the mechanism of the previous engine of fate
- Mother (humanlike air/earth genasi)
    - ancestor is Toby’s dad? air genasi parent purposefully tried to suppress child’s power
- Half elf teacher/aunt
    - Escapee from Moonflower labor camps
- Source of unpredictable power - bloodline, mixed lineage?
    - both bluemoon, toby related to deadbeat dad
- Jeweler’s guild
    - multiclass into artificer? or he learns from Luca?
- Kristynne (ex lover)
    - Married a nobleman of Avizallo to gain power
    - Working against the council's plans
- Ring

Lumdas
- ==Mangurum - home village
    - was threatened by the thing from ocean?
    - sacrifice was actually to Onkeioros? ask Michael what biome the village is. edge of Mirwood? 
- Family + elders
- Earl Sweatshirt
- Goddess of Fate
	- a sect of the religion starts advocating a new world order - tied to the Council

Toby
- ==Coriolis (”Cory”) - Djinn father - deadbeat dad
	- used arcane condenser in apostasy to split his soul, put the pieces of his soul in his children as a backup against death (is this too evil?) - this is why Toby had volatile power
	- broke his deal with a devil, ends up captured in apostasy again
	- has passed thru Kevara in the past - leave a trail to Apostasy?
- Mother
- Mysterious burst of wind power during childhood

Eletha
- Moonflower family + “philanthropy”
    - Ores mined are sold to Council, Luca Industries
- something in Mirwood points the way to the labyrinth, or to the last engine piece in langska
	- Onkeioros used the engine piece to do something before losing it - became corrupted?
- Shrewseer friend
- Monastery
    - part of the mirwood resistance

  

The fate of Kevara-Arda - political struggle, natural/arcane threats
The Cursed Ocean
Konrad Luca - capitalist
- puppet of the council
- Retro computing aesthetics: [dana siberia](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-cursed-universes-of-dana-sibera/)
Council - cultists, megalomaniacs
- want to kill the goddess of fate, create a new engine to run the universe upon - the rules and constraints of the universe, destiny
- they know abt the first engine, do they know abt the cataclysm?
- powerful men who control society, but want to control more. they think they're doing it for the good of everyone
	- order vs freedom
	- automata as perfectly predictable + controlled systems. Both the perfect citizen and the tool to control (surveil) citizens
- Based in Kevara (where?)
- hold positions in Avizallo court, Langksa, trying to use Luca to gain Kevara-Arda
- sponsoring grave robbers to find fate engine piece in Kevara, also the Felechian cult?
- experimenting on fray-tides because they know it's related to the first engine
- steps to power
	- find ancient artificer's lab on how to create advanced automata
	- find pieces of the old fate engine: arcane condenser (apostasy), under Kevara Arda (founders weapon), in mirwood related to green man/eaten by sky whale(?)
- leader is someone who eats people's fate - control over the fate engine will let them eat the fate of everyone + the world itself
	- what does it mean to lose your fate? 
	- a PC whose fate is eaten becomes a malicious NPC, an aspect of the fate eater
	- high level lieutenants of the fate eater are those whose fates were doomed, not actually a person anymore
The Big Bad
Ancient Artificer
Labyrinth (nexida)
- an automata that was uncontrollable, unpredictable - agent of chaos
Felichias: goddess of fate
- people think that fate is some omniscient force moving the paths of men - but it's really just senseless randomness
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,
- Intent, desires? force of nature or willful human?
- Manages the engine of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
	- the engine would have let you view + change the fate of an entity or an event. the BBEG would use that to change the fate of the world so it gets eaten
- the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm (Felicia Brown)


latest fad in the city is eating the memories of the dead
- can be a narcotic, forgetting your own past by living in the past of others
- graverobbers loot all the historical sites
- Vasilev is amassing a personal collection of dead pieces to resurrect as ghosts for voting
