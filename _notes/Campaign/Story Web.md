Open questions
- Steps for finding Nexida
- cosmology of apostasy wrt the cataclysm, Fate
Need to set up
- Lore around Kevar, Arda, Gilead
- Role of Felichian religion, the goddess
- Coriolis's exploits
- Legends about dragons? 


Central tensions
- running from the past
	- basically everyone's backstory
	- the world's reckoning with the past Cataclysm
	- the Council's disregard for the Cataclysm
	- the Council
	- Vasilev and her past
	- Kevara-Arda was founded on a great wrong - something that Kevar/Arda did 
		- stolen land? from the culture now in avizallo
		- reason for current inequality in the city?
		- acts as a bank - where did that seed money come from? invading/looting along the coast. Kevar+Arda were the first warlords
			- caused instability in Langska, led to rise of first emperor
- the forces of fate - what can/can't be controlled. what meaning do you make in a world that is inherently random, uncaring. 

  

Kallista
- Apostasy
	- ==philosophy? why are they focused on law, justice
		- not necessarily about law - moreso judgement, punishment, justice?
	- probably there is a bad guy associated w the council here, trying to get hold of the condenser - the opposing lawyer? (karuma)
- Dead friend
	- murder was orchestrated by someone working for BBEG, wants Kallista convicted to cover up the trail
- Criminal background + connections, assassinations + thefts
    - **in Kevara
    - took jobs from the Council
- Bard school
    - **in Kevara

Bluemoon
- Hometown is Avizallo
- Vapor (genasi father)
    - died fighting off Fray-wraith invasion
    - stronger Fray tides are because of council experimentation - trying to figure out the mechanism of the previous engine of fate
- Mother (humanlike air/earth genasi)
    - ancestor is Toby’s dad? air genasi parent purposefully tried to suppress child’s power
- Half elf teacher/aunt
    - Escapee from Moonflower labor camps
- Source of unpredictable power - bloodline, mixed lineage?
    - both bluemoon, toby related to deadbeat dad
- Jeweler’s guild
    - multiclass into artificer? or he learns from Luca?
- Kristynne (ex lover)
    - Married a nobleman of Avizallo to gain power
    - Working against the bad guy in Avizallo
- Ring

Lumdas
- Mangurum - home village
    - was threatened by the thing from ocean?
    - sacrifice was actually to Onkeioros? ask Michael what biome the village is. edge of Mirwood? 
- Family + elders
- Earl Sweatshirt
- Goddess of Fate
	- a sect of the religion starts advocating a new world order - tied to the Council
	- give this guy some prophetic dreams or whatever

Toby
- ==Coriolis (”Cory”) - Djinn father - deadbeat dad
	- ~~used arcane condenser in apostasy to split his soul, put the pieces of his soul in his children as a backup against death (is this too evil?) - this is why Toby had volatile power
	- rockstar, adventurer, false prophet, pyramid scheme boss
		- apostasy big bad is an ex of his, baited him into trying to steal the artifact
	- was captured by the Artificer in Avizallo - artificer made a wish to create his labryinth in the sky
	- now captured in apostasy - bad guy made a wish to transfer his powers away somehow?
		- was getting used by bad guy in apostasy to steal the condenser?
		- broke a deal with a devil?
	- relation to Indira Ashoor? 
		- Coriolis's daughter?!?! would have to be a year younger than Toby - she's being pursued bc Apostasy thinks she has Coriolis' power now
		- was conceived as a vessel for elemental powers, unlike toby
		- doesn't explain why Apostasy wants his powers - to also get to Nexida?
- Mother (Annalise)
	- Toby's powers actually came from her - passed her powers onto toby to protect him (from what), losing her mind in the process
	- related/necessary to find Nexida, or to the council - she worked for them?
	- wants / motives ? was a whirlwind adventurer or thief?
	- Named after Annalise's friend Tobias? who is part of the Mirwood resistance
- ==Mysterious burst of wind power at 14yrs (2y ago)
	- the Fray causes weird loci in the Weave? loss of the dragons?
	- actually also has mixed bloodline
	- Apostasy caught Coriolis and punished him, stripping him of power into a regular human. Coriolis's power tried to jump to next closest link (Toby), but it burst out of him in a destructive gust
		- Apostasy was trying to extract the power from Coriolis, but it went somewhere else
		- Coriolis has lost most of his memory, inept, deadbeat - need to build him up in order to pay off the disappointment
		- would need to establish the power transferral mechanic - maybe apostasy already uses it on fire elementals

Eletha
- Moonflower family + “philanthropy”
    - Ores mined are sold to Council, Luca Industries
- something in Mirwood points the way to the labyrinth, or to the last engine piece in langska
	- Onkeioros used the engine piece to do something before losing it - became corrupted?
- Shrewseer friend
- Monastery
    - part of the mirwood resistance

  

The fate of Kevara-Arda - political struggle, natural/arcane threats
The Fray
Konrad Luca - capitalist
- puppet of the council
- Retro computing aesthetics: [dana siberia](https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/archive/the-cursed-universes-of-dana-sibera/)
Council - cultists, megalomaniacs
- want to kill the goddess of fate, create a new engine to run the universe upon - the rules and constraints of the universe, destiny
- hold positions in Avizallo court, Langksa, trying to use Luca to gain Kevara-Arda
- experimenting on fray-tides because they know it's related to the first engine
- steps to power
	- find ancient artificer's lab on how to create advanced automata
	- find pieces of the old fate engine
Gilead, the dragon king - The Big Bad
- steps to regaining physical form?
- eats people's fate - control over the fate engine will let them eat the fate of everyone + the world itself
	- what does it mean to lose your fate? 
	- a PC whose fate is eaten becomes a malicious NPC, an aspect of the fate eater
	- high level lieutenants of the fate eater are those whose fates were doomed, not actually a person anymore
Ancient Artificer
- based in Avizallo
Labyrinth (nexida)
- an automata that was uncontrollable, unpredictable - agent of chaos
- someplace off the coast of Avizallo, further into the sea
- find his writings, maps, labs. need a special boat to get there? how to navigate thru Fray
- connection to djinn or genasi? enslaved air elementals to protect lab?? made a wish on Coriolis? so annalise was trying to get the location from coriolis?
	- you get a wish from a djinn by having them owe you a favor - or by trapping/tricking them
	- should it be a floating island
	- Bad guys might capture coriolis, or find some other way to find island
Elves
Onkeioros
Langksa + sky whales (volaceta)
Felichias: goddess of fate
- people think that fate is some omniscient force moving the paths of men - but it's really just senseless randomness
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,
- Intent, desires? force of nature or willful human?
- Manages the engine of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
	- the engine would have let you view + change the fate of an entity or an event. the BBEG would use that to change the fate of the world so it gets eaten
- the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm (Felicia Brown)


latest fad in the city is eating the memories of the dead
- can be a narcotic, forgetting your own past by living in the past of others
- graverobbers loot all the historical sites
- Vasilev is amassing a personal collection of dead pieces to resurrect as ghosts for voting

kevar + arda slayed the last dragon (gilead)
- they used its hair + heartstrings to weave the fray net, other body parts to found the city
- now is undead, trapped in a mirror?
- broken mirror motif, fates trapped within the mirror
