# Guidelines

- Similar to DE tasks?
- temporary / permanent buff to skills, new skills, feats, leveling up, magic items
- Start small - goals for sidequests
- Goals have to be things that the players mention wanting to do
- Run a full campaign where players create the goals they want to reach, tie goals to XP

Tasks do not represent the only things you can or should do in game.
Things that you (the player or the character) mention wanting to do can be codified as a task.
