A series of glass columns in the ocean. Remnants of an ancient explosion. Subtropical clime, birds nest on the glass towers

Lots of craft, artificing, artisans. Some really good magical institutions

owl (religion), gyrfalcon (guard/navy), raven (law enforcement), vulture, macaw, kingfisher (commerce), osprey, crane, hummingbird,
masks arose bc of a plague in the past

Guard wear half hawk masks; lower public servants wear half sparrow masks
- Would like to steal trade from Kevara-Arda, resents their naval prominence
- Settled several hundred yrs ago by coastal ppls fleeing the inland empire, the fray - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoonâ€™s dad)
- Patron god: the birds (collective whole seen as mouthpiece of a force)
- big sport - bird fighter kites

- First settled by ppl fleeing the empire, plague
- Strong economy of Saltwood export, but heavily dependent on Kevara for food + goods import. Prevents Avizallo from having the money to build their own ships and gain power
	- Trees that grow along the column, their roots wrapping around the glass. Birds live in the trees. Drink ocean water and weep the excess salt out of their bark. Gray-white wood.
	- Required to make prows for boats that can navigate the Fray
- floating sea grass flats at base of column for food (more lower class)
