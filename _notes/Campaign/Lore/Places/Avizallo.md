A series of glass columns in the ocean. Remnants of an ancient explosion. Subtropical clime, birds nest on the glass towers

- First settled by ppl fleeing the empire, plague - legend says they followed the birds to their new home
- Modern religious belief says that all the birds living on the columns are collectively their god
	- all birds are sacred, their movements can be interpreted as the will of god
- Reservoirs pull seawater up into the glass columns; clerics use purify drink to create aquifers
- Strong economy of Saltwood export, but heavily dependent on Kevara for food + goods import. Prevents Avizallo from having the money to build their own ships and gain power
	- Trees that grow along the column, their roots wrapping around the glass. Birds live in the trees. Drink ocean water and weep the excess salt out of their bark. Gray-white wood.
	- Required to make prows for boats that can navigate the Fray
	- Druids cultivate the trees to have them grow faster, meet supply
- floating sea grass flats at base of column for food (more lower class)

## The Council of Birds
owl (religion), gyrfalcon (guard/navy), raven (law enforcement), vulture, macaw, kingfisher (commerce), osprey, crane, hummingbird,
masks arose bc of a plague in the past

Guard wear half hawk masks; lower public servants wear half sparrow masks
- Would like to steal trade from Kevara-Arda, resents their naval prominence
- Settled several hundred yrs ago by coastal ppls fleeing the inland empire, the fray - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoonâ€™s dad)
- Patron god: the birds (collective whole seen as mouthpiece of a force)
- big sport - bird fighter kites
