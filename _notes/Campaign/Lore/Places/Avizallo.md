- Would like to steal trade from Kevara-Arda, resents their naval prominence
- Settled several hundred yrs ago by coastal ppls fleeing the inland empire, the fray - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoonâ€™s dad)
- Patron god: the birds (collective whole seen as mouthpiece of a force)
- big sport - bird fighter kites

- First settled by ppl fleeing the empire, plague
- Strong economy of Saltwood export, but heavily dependent on Kevara for food + goods import. Prevents Avizallo from having the money to build their own ships and gain power
	- Trees that grow along the column, their roots wrapping around the glass. Birds live in the trees. Drink ocean water and weep the excess salt out of their bark. Gray-white wood.
	- Required to make prows for boats that can navigate the Fray
	- Druids cultivate the trees to have them grow faster, meet supply
- floating sea grass flats at base of column for food (more lower class)
