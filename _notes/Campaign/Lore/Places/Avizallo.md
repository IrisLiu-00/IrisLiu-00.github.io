A series of glass columns in the ocean. Remnants of an ancient explosion. Subtropical clime, birds nest on the glass towers

- First settled by ppl fleeing the fray, empire, plague - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
	- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoonâ€™s dad)
- Modern religious belief says that all the birds living on the columns are collectively their god
- Reservoirs pull seawater up into the glass columns; clerics use purify drink to create aquifers
	- they don't run at night bc no one is working the fountains
- big sport - bird fighter kites

# Economics

Primary Industries
- Saltwood: trees that grow along the columns, their roots wrapping around the glass. Birds live in the trees. Drink ocean water and weep the excess salt out of their bark. Gray-white wood.
	- Required to make prows for boats that can navigate the Fray
	- Druids cultivate the trees to have them grow faster, meet supply
- Floating sea grass flats at base of column for food (more lower class)
- Fishing
- Masons' Guild: manages all the building material available on the isles. Draconian accounting of each block of stone that exists (~45760 blocks?)
	- stones are very rarely quarried and brought to avizallo from the mainland. One of the few resources that avizallo does not import via Kevara firms, because it would be prohibitively expensive (stone is heavy, and no one else buys it so economies of scale don't work out)
	- ships that can sail back to the mainland need to be made of some percentage of saltwood - avizallo has a very limited quantity of them

Kevaran Influence
- Was more independent 100 yrs ago, but Council got scared during the last expansion of the Langksaran empire > signed deals with Kevara for naval protection in return for contracts to access saltwood groves
	- Langksaran empire has receded but Kevaran influence remains
- Avizallo groves are required to sell saltwood to Kevaran merchants at set prices - laborers get underpaid
	- Laborers are mostly low lvl druids spamming Druidcraft cantrip to get trees to grow faster
	- Some higher class Avizallans make a profit by working for Kevarans to manage the groves - Court sells contract work to manage saltwood
- Heavily dependent on Kevaran imports for grains/food, textiles, building materials (metal, stone)
	- Avizallo has very few saltwood ships of its own, cannot do its own trade
	- Extremely dependent on Kevara continuing to buy saltwood, only so it can buy back the goods it is not able to purchase overseas itself
- Less of food supply is now home grown (fishing/sea grass) both bc of Kevaran imports + environmental disruption from saltwood harvesting

# Religion

- All birds residing in the isle are sacred, and represent a sort of composite will / force
- Interpret omens via bird formations
- Show devotion by feeding and caring for the birds
	- citizens generally expected to give offerings
- Church of Avizallo headed by Owl
- Birds are more of a spirit than a traditional god
	- Not a religion with many moral/philosophical tenets, devotion is primarily shown thru making offerings
	- National god - concerned specifically with wellbeing of avizallans
	- being always under the watchful wing of the birds - their care and observation
	- great acts/achievements may be recognized by the birds
- Pray to different birds for different uses - types of birds are seen as aspects of the god
	- Gull/albatross/osprey (seafaring/fishing), chicken/pigeon (hearth), falcon (war/protection from harm), parrots (agriculture), owl (wisdom/medicine), hummingbird (artisans), dove (love), vulture (peaceful death), swallows
- Clerics gain power by making offerings and force of belief - the Birds don't rly care about your actions otherwise
	- On some lvl clerics of the Birds also have power bc other devotees believe in them
