TODOS
- interesting cultural features
	- parkour
	- graffiti - magic, come alive
	- dream dimension
- interesting landmarks
	- the city is alive, the streets move and statues speak - status mechanics for how much city likes you
- name for river
- magic mechanics of the city election, patrician authority
- built on the corpse of a dragon? buildings and ships part by the patrician's will (too similar to nexida). there is a beating dragon's heart below the city
# The World's Gate

- A huge, old city state that has seen many different rulers and ages. Layers upon layers of different cultures, architectural styles, religions
- Highly influential via trade: goods go around the [[Leuchroic Sea]] and upriver inland
- Kevara is the larger, western peninsula, situated near river delta. Arda is the slightly smaller eastern peninsula
- Arda is technically still under Langska governance
- Depends on saltwood from [[Avizallo]] to build their ships
	- merchants would like to gain domination over Avizallo to buy cheaper wood

Patrician
- cannot be killed by anyone with Kevaran water in their body
	- the aqueducts + fountains are enchanted (lined with dragonscale?)
	- anyone who acts to harm the patrician has their blood boil / turn to dragonflame

Election..
- 

Kevar + Arda
- slayed the dragon king [[Gilead]] using [[Fate Engine Pieces]], claimed the land of Kevara-Arda
- founded a sort of democracy after destroying king
- Kevar: supposedly a paladin of Felichias (was he actually? Felichias tried to stop him from slaying Gilead, revoked her power from him)
- Arda: a mage (of what sort?)

# Districts
## THE DOWNS 
- Poorest, most crime ridden part of Kevara
- Primarily Vasilev's territory
- Most upriver, edge of town
- Underground arts scene - graffiti, musicians clubs
#### Bridgetown
- a series of covered bridges thru the river, technically extralegal territory. Where people go to flee the law.
- Bridge names: Shoewater, Grimslet, Bongdrop, Widdle-Over-Shine
	- Ersatz and gangs centered on Shoewater
- Loophole in the Treaty of Six Cups - gangs took over bridges with covered shops
#### Description
- silty, fishy smelling, sludgy river water full of trash
- cramped tenements, narrow alleyways paved with rough cobbles, dilapidated gas lamps
- grubby kids running in the street, laundry strung between windows
## KEVARA-SUR-MER
- Portside of Kevara where all the trade happens, center of business
- Shipyards and warehouses directly against the water
- Merchants' trading houses set further back, behind the veils
- Statues: frame the strait, founders Kevar and Arda. Locals navigate by the angle of the shadow - eg. at the 9 oâ€™clock shadow
	- Veils (arcane nets) winched to the statues protect the inner city from the Fray
	- Statues move of their own volition - point to the sea when a Fray tide is coming
#### Description
- Leviathan sea monsters with their crews surfacing at port
## VILLARONTE
- Patrician's hill, center of government
- Wealthiest neighborhoods, landed gentry
- Expensive jewelers' shops
## KINGS' END
- temples' row, markets, artisans
- some working class neighborhoods - heapside, kerrigan's end, 
- Kerrigan's lane: where the wizard Eliss Kerrigan got her ass kicked so hard that space folded upon itself
	- Mosaic tiled street, stepping on the diff colors transport you to a mirror version of the lane (rooftop? pocket dimension?)
- Sixpoints intersection
## ARDA-SUR-MER
- smaller sibling of Kevara portside, merchants don't tend to be headquartered here
- Little Gardha: originally a dwarvish neighborhood, now home to many races of small folk. Can be hard to navigate for tallmen
## KHAMGARD
- Central Arda
- Langksaran occupied
## CATACOMBS
-  hidden secrets about kevar and arda's past
- sewers hold giant crocodiles, partially tamed by merrow

# Factions

## Government
- Patrician Bacrust + Dukes. Mostly incompetent, work to protect own investments in trade and property. Dukes are hereditary, Patrician is elected.
- Often paid off by the Merchers
## Merchers
- rich trading companies with strong lobbying power. Financially back most politicians
- Giltstern: one of the most powerful companies, led by Isaiah Giltstern
- Tend to exploit working class: long hours/low wages for dock workers, sell vital goods to city at high prices
## The Technic
- New entrepreneur technocracy led by Konrad Luca. Threat to Merchants and Dukes.
- Aggressively growth oriented, work to acquire / displace multiple economic sectors (education, various guilds, governance) by using automata
- Bring reform by using automata to surveil citizens
- Somehow polluting the river
## Crime
- those pushed to the margins. Gang power is relatively weak in the city. Theft, mercenaries, extortion. Sometimes allied w Merrow
## Merrow
- Live in the river
- Descended from outcast ocean merrow
- Generally antagonistic towards landfolk, for dumping garbage in water and bringing very deep trade ships up river
### Treaty of the Six Cups
- when merrow first started settling in the river, the patrician a few hundred years ago tried to threaten them to leave, met with a representative of the merrow. Drank five cups of poisoned wine - representative withheld antidote in the sixth cup until patrician agreed to the treaty. 
- Allow merchant boats up river at set limits + schedules, not exceeding a certain depth. Allow merrow to live in river. Stated anyone living on river territory was not under city jurisdiction; excluded houseboats but forgot bridges.
## Religion
- Tends to be fragmented and diverse
- Cult of Ignoramus: blindfolded monks who believe true enlightenment is achieved by cutting off all knowledge of the world

# Conflicts/Threats
- The Fray: incursions seem to be growing more frequent, more aggressive
- Upcoming election
    - Current Patrician Nutterwoll is old, somewhat incompetent. Probably die/assassinated soon
    - Next election is in 2 years, scheming has begun
    - Only those with a valid citizenship card can vote
    - Invalidating of ballots, voting multiple times, bribery + coercion
    - Konrad Luca will try to vote
- Elven encroachment: Moonflower and Shrewseer estates are both separately trying to weaken Kevara. Would like direct trade access to East + South.
    - Largely acting covertly, have spies within upper classes
    - May work to sway the election
