The Inland Empire

Primarily human / orcish, an empire in its waning years. Highlands and plains, some forest.

Langksara: capital, built on the site of an ancient whalefall on a lake, floating gardens

History + Culture
- Orcish clans are usually matrilineal
- Empire began in a political wedding between the orc + human leaders of the area > current half orc royal bloodline
- Once a sprawling empire that controlled most of the map - has declined in the past 100 years, now mostly in the highlands. Coastline remains fragmented in city states in the wake.
- some sort of worship tied to the whales idk, circle of life
	- sky whales: lightweight transparent ochre marbled bones, like amber. a valued substance, esp in architecture
- Declined due to: the plague (100 yrs ago), Sutherland pirates, colony rebellions (one in [[Kevara-Arda]])
