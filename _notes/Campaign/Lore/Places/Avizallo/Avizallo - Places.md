		- I found something at the atoll. I don't dare commit it to writing - but if it means what I think it does, then the danger is very, very close at hand. 
		  No, back up. R always says to get the big picture first. Made my way there today at 0600, borrowed a boat from Josef. Waters were calm, no sign of the Fray or Fray wraiths. The atoll is a little less than a mile east of the Isles, further than most other docking points. It's maybe a hundred feet in diameter, a completely plain glass outcrop that rises five feet out of sea level. It was entirely unbuilt upon. No docks, no mooring poles, not even the sign of plans to start construction. I disembarked and climbed onto the platform. There were a few sahuagin bones, picked clean by scavengers. Looked like things had been washed clean by the rain. But I found a long crack running down the eastern side of the platform. Something had fallen in there - been dropped there, left behind. I took it back with me. Don't know what I'm going to do about it yet. Eagle and heron guide my hand, that my sight be steady and my aim be true. 

Kingswill docking atoll
- heavily marked private property. seems stingy as hell
