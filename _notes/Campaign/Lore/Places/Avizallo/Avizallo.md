A series of glass columns in the ocean. Remnants of an ancient explosion. Subtropical clime, birds nest on the glass towers

- First settled by ppl fleeing the fray, empire, plague - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
	- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoonâ€™s dad)
- Modern religious belief says that all the birds living on the columns are collectively their god
- Reservoirs pull seawater up into the glass columns; clerics use purify drink to create aquifers
	- Surface entrances guarded at night, but no one is running them inside. Fountains don't run at night.
	- Waterwheels painted with oil-based glyphs, inset with precious metals act as spell focus for clerics
- big sport - bird fighter kites
- settlements at column base are more in danger of Fray tide -  there is a distinct class difference
# Economics

Primary Industries
- Saltwood: trees that grow along the columns, their roots wrapping around the glass. Birds live in the trees. Drink ocean water and weep the excess salt out of their bark. Gray-white wood.
	- Required to make prows for boats that can navigate the Fray
	- Druids cultivate the trees to have them grow faster, meet supply
	- First settlers of avizallo built their industry off of trade and selling boats
- Floating sea grass flats at base of column for food (more lower class)
- Fishing
- Masons' Guild: manages all the building material available on the isles. Draconian accounting of each block of stone that exists (~45760 blocks?)
	- Almost entirely managed by the Stonecutter dwarf lineage
	- stones are very rarely quarried and brought to avizallo from the mainland. One of the few resources that avizallo does not import via Kevara firms, because it would be prohibitively expensive (stone is heavy, and no one else buys it so economies of scale don't work out)
	- ships that can sail back to the mainland need to be made of some percentage of saltwood - avizallo has a very limited quantity of them
	- other buildings are traditionally made out of saltwood + plaster (also imported)

Kevaran Influence
- Was conquered by the inland empire ~200 yrs ago
- Liberated by Kevaran navy ~100 yrs ago > signed deals with Kevara for naval protection in return for contracts to access saltwood groves
- Avizallo groves are required to sell saltwood to Kevaran merchants at set prices - laborers get underpaid
	- Laborers are mostly low lvl druids spamming Druidcraft cantrip to get trees to grow faster
	- Some higher class Avizallans make a profit by working for Kevarans to manage the groves - Court sells contract work to manage saltwood
- Avizallo is not allowed to build saltwood ships over a certain size, must buy from Kevara
- Heavily dependent on Kevaran imports for grains/food, textiles, building materials (metal, stone)
	- Avizallo has very few saltwood ships of its own, cannot do its own trade
	- Extremely dependent on Kevara continuing to buy saltwood, only so it can buy back the goods it is not able to purchase overseas itself
- Less of food supply is now home grown (fishing/sea grass) both bc of Kevaran imports + environmental disruption from saltwood harvesting
- Why doesn't Kevara just take Avizallo by force? they're reluctant bc it would most likely mean a siege, and Fray-tides make a long siege difficult
	- Kevara would win; they just haven't judged it worth it. Also fear of Langksara
- Social impacts
	- seagrass, fisheries disrupted by kevaran ships
	- black market for stone, stealing blocks off of buildings to build? Gandras' mansion used stolen blocks
	- buildings on la sul taken for kevara use?
	- crowded tenements, peeling paint - most ppl work as part of saltwood industry
	- saltwood trees pull fertilizer from fisheries
	- food - only richest can buy imported fruits, veg, meat. Others eat imported grain, home grown seagrass, sometimes fish
	- bird poaching for pets on the mainland

### Masks
- Masks guard their identities - origins in avoiding the plague, or for impartiality, safety
- Masks cannot be unwillingly removed except DC30 str check (would also significantly injure the face)
	- In death, can only be removed by consensus among the Court
- Cannot be worn by anyone who is not the owner - inflicts damage
- Immune to mind control magic that would make someone remove their mask, disclose identity
	- Also give advantage on zone of truth saves
- After death of a Bird, a civil service exam happens - highest scorer becomes successor. The other birds never find out the new one's identity. 
- Each represent aspects of the divine Birds, seen as a mouthpiece for their will
Other stuff
- Guard wear half hawk masks; lower public servants wear half sparrow masks

# Religion

- Interpret omens via bird formations
- Show devotion by feeding and caring for the birds
	- citizens generally expected to give offerings
- Church of Avizallo headed by Owl
- Birds are more of a spirit than a traditional god
	- Not a religion with many moral/philosophical tenets, devotion is primarily shown thru making offerings
	- National god - concerned specifically with wellbeing of avizallans
	- being always under the watchful wing of the birds - their care and observation
	- great acts/achievements may be recognized by the birds
- Pray to different birds for different uses - types of birds are seen as aspects of the god
	- Gull/albatross/osprey (seafaring/fishing), chicken/pigeon (hearth), falcon (war/protection from harm), parrots (agriculture), owl (wisdom/medicine), hummingbird (artisans), dove (love), vulture (peaceful death), swallows
- Clerics gain power by making offerings and force of belief - the Birds don't rly care about your actions otherwise
