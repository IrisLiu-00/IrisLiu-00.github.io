Old, deep forest. Primarily ruled by wood elves, divided into territories (estates) - however, there are also many parts which are independent.

Old god - the green man, Onkeioros, cancerous overflowing growth. One of the first gods formed after the cataclysm

Interests:
- conflicts with non elf coastal settlements (Kevara-Arda) over deforestation
- would like to see other city states populated with elven / elven sympathetic governments - build a protective sphere around mirwood
	- increased social stratification over non-elves gathers espirae

Moonflower Estate:
- One of the most prominent, Eletha’s old home
- Shelters for orphans / underserved residents are actually labor camps to mine precious ores deep within the forest
- The Moonflower espirans sell ore (elf’s tears, misurium) to other elven estates (including the Shrewseers, family of Eletha’s childhood friend) - the lucrative business deal gets them a lot of espirae, as does their exploitation of the orphans
- Secretly working for [[Onkeioros]]
- Look down on Shrewseers

Shrewseer Estate
- new money, don't know about Onkeioros

About elves:
- Lifespan varies by social class: 150 yrs for lower class up to 1000 for highest class
- Espirae: the sort of magical energy that gives elves their lifespan
    - Nature is largely unknown, except that it is generated through the social contracts between elves (and to a lesser extent, elves and non-elves)
- Highly stratified society where everyone reports to an Espiran (lord, referred as sir/dame)
    - Lower elves swear covenants (magical oaths) to their superiors, which generates a lot of espirae for the lord and a little for the peon
    - Espirae is also generated through other sorts of covenants - eg. business agreements
