## Korunda Pass & the desert

Korunda Pass: big trading city on the edge of the desert, located in a canyon of a mesa. Start of the overland trade route from the ocean (via Kevara river) towards the westerlands.

Desert is the site of an ancient catastrophe (thousands of years ago). Parts of the desert are still crystallized glass from whatever blasted the landscape.

## Candlekeep

## Other Places

- Isle of Piranesi - automata labyrinth
    - Luca Piranesi (mage) studied the creation of automatons, was the only one to ever create a fully realized intelligence
    - Created the automaton to guard his notes, aid him in further research
    - Did bad experiments on her, refused to recognize her contributions
    - Imprisoned in the labyrinth because he feared her power
    - ultimately killed by the automata
- Undersea jellyfish city (maybe bluemoonâ€™s dad is from here?)
