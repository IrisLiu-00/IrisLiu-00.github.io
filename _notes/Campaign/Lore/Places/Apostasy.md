A long rift into the crust of the earth, leagues deep. At the bottom of the rift lies the Hellmouth, where magma continuously bubbles from the fires of hell - this is a place where the boundary between planes is thin. Tieflings and other beings of infernal origin have built a kingdom in the upper reaches of the canyon - iron bridges and spires span the great gap, and dwelling places with intricate facades are carved directly into the rock walls. Ruled by the Iron Magistrates, arbiters of justice, order, law, and punishment.

Located far to the west, past the desert and more. Little of the rest of the world knows where the Hellmouth is - some legends say it’s in a volcano in the sea, some say its far to the north. Many agree that it’s a land of fantastical engineering and jeweled riches.

- Lawyers / judges are warlocks who consult devils of the infernal plane - on how to interpret infernal laws, powers to mete punishment, drawing up magical contracts, creating new laws
- Laws are just a very extensive magical contract housed in the infernal plane - all citizens are sworn by blood to it
- Extreme rule of law, very little crime

- demons who managed to escape to the material plane and gain physical form, using the condenser
- Using Arcane Condenser ([[Fate Engine Pieces]]) to pull energy from infernal plane, hold open the rift, power the city
	- rumors of great treasure and wealth are actually the arcane condenser
	- without the condenser, the city gets sucked into the infernal plane
