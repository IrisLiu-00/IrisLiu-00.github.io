# Notes
- Duke of several outlying districts of Kevara
- Looking to usurp the Patrician’s power, guard Kevara from creeping influence of the elves + Avizallo
    - how are the elves, other dukes, avizallo threatening?
- Strict, fair, but Machiavellan - has killed a decent number of people
    - Looking to levy a better tax system on the countryside fiefdoms
    - Divert city funding to public health + infrastructure - much if it is currently hemorrhaged via corruption, lobbyists (dock warehouse overseers, gentrification)
    - Allies with organized crime to try to curb their activity
        - Crime doesn’t happen because people just decide to stab pedestrians for fun; crime happens when people feel that they don’t have the power to affect change within the bounds of society. In that case, the existence of crime reflects a failure of society, not of morality.
### Backstory
- Publicly presents as male, transed her gender ~teen years?
- Old Duke Vasilev adopted a drow son (Victoro) for the status, Venka came along as a page / playmate / scullery boy
    - Venka assassinated the old duke, sent Victoro back to Underdark > took Victoro’s identity as heir
- Deeply ashamed of past - abuse, low origins, old weakness
- Common rumor that Venka assassinated adopted father
### Positioning
- Holds the decryption key to Giltstern communications 
- Getting grave relics to spoof election votes
- Always drinks from a flask to avoid the dragon curse - so she can eventually poison the Patrician
