- Goddess of Fate
- Manages the engine of fate - old style computer, ticker tape. dice tower?
	- the engine would have let you view + change the fate of an entity or an event. the BBEG would use that to change the fate of the world so it gets eaten
- Felicia Brown - the lone remaining human from before the cataclysm
	- One of the scientists (lab tech?) who built the fate engine
	- In the last moments as the engine activated, she realized it was pulling apart reality and was able to salvage it by manually running the fate engine
- People think that fate is some omniscient force moving the paths of men - but it's really just senseless randomness
    - she’s not the DM, she’s the DICE
    - Bluemoon’s magic surges, Kallista’s accidental murder, Earl getting picked by lottery, Alexa missing the carriage out of her estate and deciding to go visit the orphanage,

Church of Felichias
- Worshipped in many places along the Leuchroic coast, esp among humans and dwarves
- Tenets
	- Surrender of self to fate, acceptance
	- There are no coincidences - all things are a sign
	- Some focus more on the idea that Felichias has laid out their path for them
	- Some justify their actions using Felichias - if it was not as she wished, it would not happen
