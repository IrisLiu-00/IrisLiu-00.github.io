- The golden dragon king
- Found out the nature of the fray and the fate engine - tried to save the fates of people endangered by it. His hoard became the fates
	- The fray used to expand far beyond the sea and was growing - antithetical to existence, snuffing out the fates of ppl who would otherwise have lived to do other things
- Gained power as he grew his hoard, began re-raveling the Weave, making the coast livable
- Kevar and Arda took the land once it was exposed, thinking Gilead was just a monster
- Now corrupted by rage and grief. Just wants to eat fates to destroy others, gain power
- Wants to build the fate engine to change the fate of the entire world - so Gilead can eat it and start everything anew. Wants to make everything be just like before. 
	- tempt the players - don't you wish you could go back to before everything went wrong? I could rewrite fate so that things were always as they were

- located somewhere underground in Kevara, but can't do much? what form does he take
- foil for Vasilev? also female but assumed male?
	- V looks towards the future; G towards the past

- Use Luca as a pawn to become Patrician > eat Luca's fate and control him > use Luca to regain physical form from the pieces of him left in the city
	- if V wins, he will try to somehow get Vasilev's fate - depending on what the PCs do

Philosophies
- Gilead: it has to be this way. pinning it down and preserving it. eternal, untarnishing. overbearing protectiveness, mother dragon.
	- taking hold of others' fates to "save" them. fixing their destiny into a grotesque caricature of who they were. 
- Felichias / true fate: it can be any way. surrender of control. changeful, shifting.

- eat a person's fate - when they hit 0hp
	- what does this actually mean? what happens to the victim? Gilead becomes free to control their fate as he sees fit
	- is fate randomness, or is it destiny? what does it mean to eat a person's randomness? to eat their potential?
