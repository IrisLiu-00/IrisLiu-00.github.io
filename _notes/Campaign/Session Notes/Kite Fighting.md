Tank: hi durance / low power /  low lift / hi agility /  
Glass cannon: low durance / hi power / hi lift / low agility
lift is inverse to agility (big surface area makes it hard to make turns)
durance is inverse to power (thicker line makes it harder to cut others)

Betting: Odds of each kite is the monetary return of it winning a duel against the average kite. Odds of a kite winning against a specific other kite is its odds divided by the other's.
- The probability of a kite winning a battle is 1/odds
