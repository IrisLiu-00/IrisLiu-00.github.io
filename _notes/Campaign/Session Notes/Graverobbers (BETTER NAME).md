# Scenes

Open questions
- is the assassination thing too similar to Avizallo storyline

- seems like should follow up on Luca, Clockwork
	- wealthy ppl, companies suddenly very interested in using Luca's automata as weapons - possibly disastrous results, the bots only have the one setting to kill everything. appear towards endgame of adv, near breakdown of order
	- clockwork definitely knows from Feldspar that Kallista actually looks different - going to be chasing her
		- clockwork tries to cut a deal with vasilev?
- kind of a culmination of the initial kevara arc, before we go onto avizallo
	- orngrym hires Luca automatas, returns as a threat
	- clockwork usurps merriwink's thieves guild to bait the party. Or infiltrates Kallista's school. miniboss fight
	- lead up to fighting Leanna

- Someone is trying to figure out V (either a Kevara noble or Leanna)
	- start with a direct threat on V? someone trying to break in or sth. a cultist tries to kill her during the show
	- Orngrym threatens V's council seat
- go graverobbing for Vasilev - work w a graverobbing operation and steal the bones from them
- fancy opera show or something - learn abt the eating bones thing, get contacts for a graverobbing party
	- Vasilev wants souls to spoof votes in upcoming election
	- morality play sponsored by the church. lore vehicle for city founding
- corpse eating - corse-mange / scyro / soulsmoke / soulsweal
	- latest fad among the wealthy is consuming the memories of the dead
	- souls leave an imprint on bodily remains - use a ritual to amplify them
	- smoke via a long skinny opium pipe
	- consuming enough gives abilities / knowledge the dead had
	- drug mechanics for PC consumption - force a save against possession
- dungeon/catacombs under Kallista's school
	- Lyell + Ringley turn up again? to do what 
	- Coriolis was guest lecturing there
- lead up to a miniboss - a cult actually working for the council trying to get engine piece
	- Cult leader - necrichor, remnant cultist, drow mage?
- Leanna leading the cult
	- disgraced after heist, banished from shrewseer's retinue
	- council contact in avizallo gave her powers in return for searching for artifact in catacombs
		- ritual for grave eating- gained further power by eating memories of some old necro (find the plundered grave as a part of adventure)
		- what kind of person is the council contact? eaters of memories (oblex, false hydra, hydroloth, amnizu, illithid), fate, desire, dream, willpower
	- leanna is running the cult to try and get back in shrewseer's good graces
		- assassinate prominent lords, priests. this is not very personal stakes tho. she also starts coming for the PCs? samples contaminated w bones from a serial killer, so drug users get possessed by a ghost
			- leanna is controlling the ghost, make it part of the boss fight
			- ghosts as prior monsters in the dungeon
			- the ghost was some religious fanatic slasher?
			- possessed ppl become cultists
		- change to abuction ? smokers get possessed and then leave
		- or she's stealing targets money?
	- dressed as a widow. 8 ft tall, black mourning dress, full veil over head. flips hair, eyes like chips of ice, curled lip. hates eletha for her status
	- stats - druid + necro stuff?

Goals
- a longer adventure, multiple stages
	- opera, dungeon crawl, church infiltration (both felichias + the cult)?
- more player agency
- ending should introduce the big bad (council), lead to Mirwood or Avizallo (player choice)

Big Picture
- someone needs to try to kill the Patrician
- start planting the artificer's code (symbols for letters, RTL text)
- relate to quest for engine piece, history of city
- give a chance to learn about Vasilev's backstory
- plant seeds for Vasilev's election gambit

Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.

Opera Show
- Vasilev brought them here to find an in with the graverobbers
- morality play sponsored by the church, lore vehicle abt KA + dragon
- assassination attempt (on who? one of the young lords smoking? Ornsgrym?)

Location/NPCs for contacting the graverobbers
- for if the PCs try to pursue the necro at the show
- where do they get information about where to go
- an archaeologists/graverobbers' guild - prolly a front for the cult
	- location: a museum? coffeehouse? something cool. Kerrigan's lane?
	- possibly sponsored by a lord? by lord Ornsgrym to collect art?
- what do all the factions think: V, lords, Patrician, merchers, bridgers, merrow, avizallo
	- V - focused on getting grave goods for the election
	- lords move to outlaw drugs, but ppl who have used in the past are still possessed
	- rival lord offers a job to investigate V - thinks she is behind the assassinations. Then assassination attempt on V
	- merchers
	- bridgers try to get in on the drug trade, don't care much about assassinations
	- avizallo
	- 

Clockwork baits Kallista
- either usurps Merriwink's thieves or Kallista school
- Merriwink says she has a tip about the graverobbers

More assassination attempts - requires PCs to be in public situations
- it shouldn't be immediately clear that the assassins are all smokers
- PCs are called on as security detail? for liasons with elves or avizallo? guard a saltwood shipment?
- attempt on Patrician's life - assailant dies
- nobles hire automata - potential encounter where automata go out of control or sth
- attempt on Vasilev - someone infiltrates her house. why would the PCs be in her house at night
- if they still don't care, attempt to kill the PCs

Dungeon: under Kallista's school
- find the artificer's code
- Final face off: Leanna + ghost in lair
