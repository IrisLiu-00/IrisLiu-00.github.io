# Scenes

- seems like should follow up on Luca, Clockwork
	- wealthy ppl, companies suddenly very interested in using Luca's automata as weapons - possibly disastrous results, the bots only have the one setting to kill everything. appear towards endgame of adv, near breakdown of order
	- clockwork definitely knows from Feldspar that Kallista actually looks different - going to be chasing her
		- clockwork tries to cut a deal with vasilev?
- kind of a culmination of the initial kevara arc, before we go onto avizallo

- dungeon/catacombs under Kallista's school
	- Lyell + Ringley turn up again? to do what 
	- Coriolis was guest lecturing there

Goals
- a longer adventure, multiple stages
	- opera, cult infiltration?, dungeon crawl, 
- more player agency
- ending should introduce the big bad (council), lead to Mirwood or Avizallo (player choice)

Big Picture
- start planting the artificer's code (symbols for letters, RTL text)
- relate to quest for engine piece, history of city
- give a chance to learn about Vasilev's backstory
- plant seeds for Vasilev's election gambit



Location/NPCs for contacting the graverobbers
- for if the PCs try to pursue the necro at the show
- where do they get information about where to go
- an archaeologists/graverobbers' guild - prolly a front for the cult
	- location: a museum? coffeehouse? something cool. Kerrigan's lane?
	- possibly sponsored by a lord? by lord Ornsgrym to collect art?
- what do all the factions think: V, lords, Patrician, merchers, bridgers, merrow, avizallo
	- V - focused on getting grave goods for the election
	- lords move to outlaw drugs, but ppl who have used in the past are still possessed
	- rival lord offers a job to investigate V - thinks she is behind the assassinations. Then assassination attempt on V
	- merchers
	- bridgers try to get in on the drug trade, don't care much about assassinations
	- avizallo
	- 

More assassination attempts - requires PCs to be in public situations
- it shouldn't be immediately clear that the assassins are all smokers
- PCs are called on as security detail? for liasons with elves or avizallo? guard a saltwood shipment?
- attempt on Patrician's life - assailant dies
- nobles hire automata - potential encounter where automata go out of control or sth
- attempt on Vasilev - someone infiltrates her house. why would the PCs be in her house at night
- if they still don't care, attempt to kill the PCs

Info the PCs need to find the dungeon
- assassination attempts are connected to the smoke
- smoke is supplied by Ornsgrym, who gets it from the archaeological society?
- the archaeological society is a front for the cult
- the archaeologists are planning a dig under the school / the cult is based there
	- specific passcode or sth to get in?

## The Show
- Vasilev brought them here to find an in with the graverobbers
	-  Vasilev wants souls to spoof votes in upcoming election
- musical play by the Sirenian players, lore vehicle abt KA + dragon
- assassination attempt (on who? one of the young lords smoking? Ornsgrym?)
- Duke Filroy's young nephew (crunch moon vibes)
- things they can find out
	- the necromancer supplying the smokes - she's not directly involved in their manufacture, but most of the young lords have been purchasing from Ornsgrym. Ornsgrym will be public at the send off of a Kevara diplomat tmr, most likely will also be selling. 
	- the assassin - has just smoked. Only talks about the composition or is catatonic. Removing possession leaves them with no memory of events

### Elysian Fog
- Nacreous, shimmering, thick smoke, taken by a long pipe (like opium pipe)
- Taking a drag fills you with a heady, floaty feeling, and you start to see faces and scenery in the smoke surrounding you. The release of being anyone but yourself. It smokes clean, there's no low after effects wear off. 
	- similar to possession, but not technically true possession because the original soul is not there
- Souls leave an imprint on bodily remains, process via ritual into flammable substance
- Possession: DC10 WIS save against possession, increases by 2 for every usage of the smoke

1hr 1d4 bonus to some sort of check
price scales based on how desirable / rare the figure was
adventurers, nobles, kerrigan the mage, performers?, the great leviathan captain Azolar Avila buried with his first mate and all his deckhands in the ribcage of his leviathan, criminals?, a retainer in the old Duke Vasilev court?, warrior (during empire invasion), a religious figure?

## The Brightides Festival
- festival for the start of the trading season - when the trade winds turn
- priests provide readings of the signs for the city and individuals
- Sixpoints plaza in Kings' End - cordoned off, have the PCs figure out how to get in (challenges against? the automata, guards)
- ==this is a weak concept! Semireligious ceremony for safe travels? get some city magic in there
- A diplomat is being sent off to Avizallo to discuss the coming year's saltwood trade - Kevara has not built new ships in nearly a decade
	- make this the murder victim - gyrfalcon?
- A sparrow-masked Avizallo diplomat is also there
- Ornsgrym has hired lots of automata for safety, Giltstern + other merchants r there
- Patrician is there, mostly useless. Speech about the Fray
- Assassination on Ornsgrym, some merchants, Patrician (unsuccessful)
- Lord Fitzroy tries to hire the PCs to investigate Vasilev - noticeably absent from the event
- should there be a combat encounter here? depending on if PCs try to stop assassins
	- challenge - if PCs try to prevent assassins while also staying undercover

## Clockwork's Trap
- either usurps Merriwink's thieves or Kallista school
- Merriwink says she has a tip about the graverobbers - in return for some sort of fetch quest?
- do the Kerrigan fight here?

## The Kevara-Arda Archaeological Society
- Lyell and ringley are here as consultants, trying to make some money - they're maybe researching gilead? city founding?

## The Dungeon
### The School
- Arda-side bard school
### Background
- ==a solid theme!!
- disused basement ? performing rooms

### The Cult of Song
- Leanna is the cult leader
	- Disgraced after the Strigoia debacle, trying to get back into Shrewseer's good graces. Trying to destabilize the city so Shrewseer can come seize power
	- Hates Eletha for being born into status
	- Dressed as a widow. 8 ft tall, black mourning dress, full veil over head. flips hair, eyes like chips of ice, curled lip
	- stats: necrichor, remnant cultist, drow mage?
- Possessing cultists to carry out assassinations against prominent Kevarans
- Grave goods are doped with bone from the slasher, so that smokers get possessed
- Assassins say something like: the songs of the dead are the most beautiful of all / may your dying screams join the eternal chorus / for the final composition
==Council Contact - who?
- Gave Leanna necromantic powers in return for her searching for the Lance of Kevar in the catacombs
	- TODO: clues for this

### The Butcher Balladeer
- student who auditioned for second violin on the Sirenian players - but was rejected in favor of guitar player Coriolis
	- the troupe decided to downsize their classical music budget in favor of appealing to the youths - went for rock opera instead
- started murdering teachers + students, discovered the screams of the dead were a musical inspiration
- french, pretentious art student vibes - critique screams for being of key
- plays the shrieks of the dead on their violin - reskinned banshee
### Layout
- 3 levels, 3 areas in each level
- find the artificer's code
- Final face off: Leanna + ghost in lair
- reduced threat ghosts as prior monsters in the dungeon - victims of the slasher
- patrol outside - see if players notice
- have cultists run away to alert others (retreat on round 2, alert on round 3)
- bad guys target the light armored ones first
- resting -> chance of a random encounter?
- have the cultists take a captive to rescue?
- secret treasure room behind a riddle
Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.
