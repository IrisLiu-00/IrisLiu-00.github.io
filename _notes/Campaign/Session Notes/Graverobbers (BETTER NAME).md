# Scenes

	- morality play sponsored by the church. lore vehicle for city founding
- corpse eating - corse-mange / scyro / 
	- latest fad among the wealthy is consuming the memories of the dead
	- souls leave an imprint on bodily remains - use a ritual to amplify them
	- Infuse corpse remains into tinctures, sold by the droplet
	- consuming enough gives abilities / knowledge the dead had
- dungeon/catacombs under Kallista's school
	- Lyell + Ringley turn up again? to do what 
	- Coriolis was guest lecturing there

- Leanna leading the cult
	- disgraced after heist, banished from shrewseer's retinue
	- council contact in avizallo gave her powers in return for searching for artifact in catacombs
		- ritual for grave eating- gained further power by eating memories of some old necro (find the plundered grave as a part of adventure)
		- what kind of person is the council contact? eaters of memories (oblex, false hydra, hydroloth, amnizu), fate, desire, dream, willpower
	- leanna is running the cult to try and get back in shrewseer's good graces
		- get ppl addicted? resurrect ghosts to attack? take over the church? resurrect the plague? use soul fragments to brainwash ppl?

	- dressed as a widow. 8 ft tall, black mourning dress, full veil over head. flips hair, eyes like chips of ice, curled lip. hates eletha for her status
	- stats - druid + necro stuff?

Goals
- a longer adventure, multiple stages
	- opera, dungeon crawl, church infiltration (both felichias + the cult)?
- more player agency
- ending should introduce the big bad (council), lead to Mirwood or Avizallo (player choice)

Big Picture
- start planting the artificer's code (symbols for letters, RTL text)
- relate to quest for engine piece, history of city
- give a chance to learn about Vasilev's backstory
- plant seeds for Vasilev's election gambit

Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.
