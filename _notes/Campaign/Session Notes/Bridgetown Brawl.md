# Scenes

### Strong Start

PCs have been free for a few weeks, ask what they’ve been up to

  

3am, the sound of a click-BANG heard from the street outside Ass Place

- Darkness except for a torch (20ft light) mounted on carriage
- A large, covered wooden carriage drawn by 4 horses careening down the cobblestones. Front door opened, a guard standing next to driver is wrestling with a long haired dwarf. Behind the carriage, a gang of three people running behind, trying to grab onto the back of the carriage. Further back in the road, a black scorch mark with two people lying unconscious
- Carriage moves 30ft on guard’s initiative
- Basta wrestles an explosive away from guard and chucks at enemies (PCS or horses) - DC 14 dex save in 10ft radius for 2d6 fire damage
- Thieves will try to wrestle open back loading door - also trapped with an explosive (10ft radius beyond the carriage)
- Tumble out: crate of metal ore, silvery-gold metal in round or teardrop shaped crystals
    - Elf’s tears / misurium from moonflower mines
- Tumble out: 2 ineffective automata, branded Luca Industries
    - Take some damage from bandits > shockback to stun
    - sort of humanoid, treads on bottom, long forklike arms
    - “greetings - would you require - assistance with that - object?”
- Bandits will run if hurt enough

Post battle

- Feldspar + Konrad Luca show up to clean up
    - recognizes Kallista from their date - why’d she never call him back?
    - was a shipment meant for Giltstern
    - never used to see filth on the streets several years ago - things are going under these days (sideways remark on vasilev enabling gang activity, it’s undemocratic)
- Konrad Luca: human man, 30s, patched coat but neatly dressed
    - affable, extremely ambitious
- happen to finish at the steps of Manor Vasilev: V comes out, comments on the blood on doorstep, beckons them in

### Mission Assignment

Setting: Manor Vasilev

- Takes up nearly half a block. Narrow, gothic building of dark gray stone, lots of ornamental stonework. Dark oak door set into a deep portico. Wrought iron gate, finely manicured yard. Half wild, black peacocks perch among the gables.
- Silk wallpaper, furnishings are expensive but have an air of disuse. A number of footmen stand silently in intervals, dressed in black + indigo livery.
- Up a spiral staircase into the tower office
- Office looks the most used. Comparatively spartan. Large black oak desk strewn with papers. Bookshelf behind, cabinet holds a bottle of whisky.
- up in his high tower office, you can see almost all of kevara - the river moves in a slow silty sludge, crisscrossed by bridges, all the way to the harbor where even now there's the glow of firelight on water as ships load and unload into harbor - bringing grain and textiles and spices to supply the hundreds of city states along the lacunian coast. across the strait you can just barely see the lights of Kevara's sister city, where you can imagine the monumental statues of Kevar and Arda facing each other across the water. Beyond that, to the north -- nothing. Just the white nothingness of the Fray. You catch a glimpse of a map pinned to the office wall, showing the Lacunian sea and its surrounds - Kevara-Arda looks so small on it. [show the map]

Vasilev gives mission to find a spy amongst Bridgetown gangs and deliver to the gang leader Ersatz

- Dismisses a page boy - the Rutherfords have not been paying the correct tithe. Numbers on pages 4-12 are clearly fabricated; Mrs Rutherford takes Langska orange blossom in her tea and there’s no possibility they’re affording that with this income.
- Salt codes to tap stonespeak within Giltstern trading firm
    - Complicated contraption on desk - stone of farspeech mounted atop an engraved disk
    - A snake within Bridgetown, code named Twopenny - will compromise V’s position with Bridgetown if cannot eliminate merchant interference
    - Some sort of “guest” from faraway, but V has not heard of anything
- Caution: Bridgetown is extralegal. PCs will not have protection from the law or Duke V
- Potential background about: gangs, relation w landed elite, bridgetown, treaty of the six cups
    - Gangs loot trade barges coming up river (w help from merrow), have been persistent annoyance to merchants
- Part of an alliance made with the gangs - they will supply Vasilev money for upcoming election
- They can start at Shoewater bridge and meet Ersatz
- Pay: 600gp
- What are they doing about Basta? still tied up in apartment (awake by now)
    - still drunk - don’t call pamela

### Investigation in Bridgetown

Setting: Shoewater

- Shady part of the city, narrow roads and tightly crammed apartments. River turns wide and sluggish, greasy brown-green. Smell of briny algae with an undercurrent of sewage.
- The banks all along the river are built up high, so that trading galleons can fit under the bridges
- The largest of the extralegal bridges, and the first. Wide stone bridge with terracotta roofed buildings on either side. Smaller shacks + tents take up space in the central concourse. Puffs of greasy cooking smoke. Random things strung up between buildings: laundry, shards of colored glass, rusted helmets. Some houses have boats strung on the outside railing of the bridge
- Urchins running on the street, stray dogs. People cooking in the street on coal stoves. A forlorn ministrel tooting at a pan flute. Tough looking men and women sharpening weapons.
- How do you go about finding Ersatz? Leave space for PC’s criminal contacts

Giselle’s

- Cinnabar working on the grouting of one of the nicer, 3 story buildings (whitewashed and painted with flowers)
    - Lives + works in Bridgetown, maintaining the masonry
    - Not the best pay, but there’s always a lot of work from random arson attempts. Someday he’ll get out of here and get on a nice project with the city - there’s talk from the merchants of re-engineering the river
- Giselle chases out a ferrety looking, ragged little man (Usha/Mushika) with a hatpin - tell him to stop bothering her girls

Ersatz the Crook

- Residency is a top floor on a building. Where the war council meets, so to speak. Close quarters, cluttered with knickknacks. Window overlooking the river, other bridges in distance.
- Offers finest imported coffee (hot brown water with bits of sticks), any of his specialty wares
    - tin + glass jewelry (20gp), heavy jade stone dice that always roll double ones (5gp), slippers of luck (30gp)
- Gangs have suffered a chain of recent blows, suspect a rat - a Duke’s secretary they bought out has been caught, planned burglaries encountered guards, black market dealers they buy from have been taken out
- Ersatz believes the room has to be secure, but that one of his close associates may have betrayed him. There’s information that has only been discussed in this room that has been leaked.
- He only talks to a few people that regularly: his guard Basta, the goblin Merriwink, the lady Giselle
- Investigation:
    - walls are thick - seems like solid stone. Low chances of anyone eavesdropping thru floors/walls
    - some papers in drawer, but less than you would expect for a crimelord - the Bridgetowners do most planning by word
    - an abandoned bathtub on the near bank, with a figure inside (Sophia)
    - traces of vermin (holes in the wall, animal scat)

The Bent Knuckle

- Group of goblins playing [King and his Men](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/srt477/the_king_and_his_men_another_mini_game_for_your/)
- Cinnabar is there
- Clockwork waltzes in. Orders orange juice + milk.
    - Friendly conversation, special interest in Kallista, ask if they ever see any other tieflings in Kevara
    - Abrasive, make fun of some people
    - The Bridgetowners are all going under sooner than they think - Cinnabar is smart to try and get out early
    - Leaves when his guards find him (tho the Bridgers will be upset abt merchers being there)

  

### The Merrow

Something else breaks bad, conflict with/pulls in merrow [combat]

- Fight aboard punts on the rivers, merrow and river beasts try to pull them in
- Basta manning the boat?
- Probably have some land based antagonists too
- Feldspar told some merrow to capture Cinnabar, that he is the one selling info to the merchers - Cinnabar is not a real Bridgetowner because he has a real business in the city, has been promised work contracts w merchers to dredge + re-engineer the river for commerce
    - Merrow know Cinnabar works for Vasilev, assumes V has betrayed them
- [Underwater Combat](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/38d5st/drowning_checks_in_5e/)
    - Disadv + resistance for non piercing melee. Ranged weapons do not work except crossbow.
    - Swim check each round to not get swept 5ft downriver + sink 5ft
    - If fighting, survive CON score / 2 rounds before drop to 0hp
    - Verbal spellcasting takes 2 * spell lvl + 1 rounds of breath

### Finding Feldspar

Confounding challenge from the sea

- magic nets get winched up from the statues, seawalls go up - hard to get places

Go to Feldspar (where? his nice apt? workplace?)

- Dockside / Merchant’s row is locked down bc of something from the sea
- Feldspar is taking tea with Luca?
- Feldspar is hosting Clockwork in his apt > confronts them, potential fight
- Merchants are confused why a tiefling with the seals of the Iron Magistrates have arrived in Kevara, but they don’t want to turn down an opportunity to plunder the treasures of Apostasy
- Show Feldspar to be genuinely vicious
    - friendly, smiling, playboy
    - reveals that Clockwork is going after Indira (Kallista)?

### Battle on the Bridge

- merchants plan to take out the Bridgers once and for all by blowing up the bridges
- All bridgefolk are stunned from automata shockwave
- Mushika (as rat) has planted mines on the underside of bridge
    - Mines are Clockwork’s invention
    - give him a bomb also?
- Fight across the bridge to chase Mushika, who holds the detonator
- Automata contracted from Luca Industries hold the bridge, have pinned down all the Bridgefolk
    - Have already used up their Shockwave attk
