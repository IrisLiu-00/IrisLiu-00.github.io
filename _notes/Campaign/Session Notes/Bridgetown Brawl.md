# Scenes

### Strong Start

PCs have been free for a few weeks, ask what they’ve been up to

3am, the sound of a click-BANG heard from the street outside Ass Place
- Darkness except for a torch (20ft light) mounted on carriage
- A large, covered wooden carriage drawn by 4 horses careening down the cobblestones. Front door opened, a guard standing next to driver is wrestling with a long haired dwarf. Behind the carriage, a gang of three people running behind, trying to grab onto the back of the carriage. Further back in the road, a black scorch mark with two people lying unconscious
- Carriage moves 30ft on guard’s initiative
- Basta wrestles an explosive away from guard and chucks at enemies (PCS or horses) - DC 14 dex save in 10ft radius for 2d6 fire damage
- Thieves will try to wrestle open back loading door - also trapped with an explosive (10ft radius beyond the carriage)
- Tumble out: crate of metal ore, silvery-gold metal in round or teardrop shaped crystals
    - Elf’s tears / misurium from moonflower mines
- Tumble out: 2 ineffective automata, branded Luca Industries
    - Take some damage from bandits > shockback to stun
    - sort of humanoid, treads on bottom, long forklike arms
    - “greetings - would you require - assistance with that - object?”
- Bandits will run if hurt enough

Post battle
- Feldspar + Konrad Luca show up to clean up
    - recognizes Kallista from their date - why’d she never call him back?
    - was a shipment meant for Giltstern
    - never used to see filth on the streets several years ago - things are going under these days (sideways remark on vasilev enabling gang activity, it’s undemocratic)
- Konrad Luca: human man, 30s, patched coat but neatly dressed
    - affable, extremely ambitious
- happen to finish at the steps of Manor Vasilev: V comes out, comments on the blood on doorstep, beckons them in

### Mission Assignment

Setting: Manor Vasilev
- Takes up nearly half a block. Narrow, gothic building of dark gray stone, lots of ornamental stonework. Dark oak door set into a deep portico. Wrought iron gate, finely manicured yard. Half wild, black peacocks perch among the gables.
- Silk wallpaper, furnishings are expensive but have an air of disuse. A number of footmen stand silently in intervals, dressed in black + indigo livery.
- Up a spiral staircase into the tower office
- Office looks the most used. Comparatively spartan. Large black oak desk strewn with papers. Bookshelf behind, cabinet holds a bottle of whisky.
- Up in his high tower office, you can see almost all of kevara - the river moves in a slow silty sludge, crisscrossed by bridges, all the way to the harbor where even now there's the glow of firelight on water as ships load and unload into harbor - bringing grain and textiles and spices to supply the hundreds of city states along the leuchroic coast. across the strait you can just barely see the lights of Kevara's sister city, where you can imagine the monumental statues of Kevar and Arda facing each other across the water. Beyond that, to the north -- nothing. Just the white nothingness of the Fray. You catch a glimpse of a map pinned to the office wall, showing the Leuchroic sea and its surrounds - Kevara-Arda looks so small on it. [show the map]

Vasilev gives mission to find a spy amongst Bridgetown gangs and deliver to the gang leader Ersatz
- Dismisses a page boy - the Rutherfords have not been paying the correct tithe. Numbers on pages 4-12 are clearly fabricated; Mrs Rutherford takes Langska orange blossom in her tea and there’s no possibility they’re affording that with this income.
- Salt codes to tap stonespeak within Giltstern trading firm
    - Complicated contraption on desk - stone of farspeech mounted atop an engraved disk
    - A snake within Bridgetown, code named Twopenny - will compromise V’s position with Bridgetown if cannot eliminate merchant interference
    - Some sort of “guest” from faraway, but V has not heard of anything
- Caution: Bridgetown is extralegal. PCs will not have protection from the law or Duke V
- Potential background about: gangs, relation w landed elite, bridgetown, treaty of the six cups
    - Gangs loot trade barges coming up river (w help from merrow), have been persistent annoyance to merchants
- Part of an alliance made with the gangs - they will supply Vasilev money for future plans (upcoming election)
- They can start at Shoewater bridge and meet Ersatz
- Pay: 600gp
- What are they doing about Basta? still tied up in apartment (awake by now)
    - still drunk - don’t call pamela

### Investigation in Bridgetown

Setting: Shoewater
- Shady part of the city, narrow roads and tightly crammed apartments. River is wide and sluggish, greasy brown-green. Smell of briny algae with an undercurrent of sewage.
- The banks all along the river are built up high, so that trading galleons can fit under the bridges
- The largest of the extralegal bridges, and the first. Wide stone bridge with terracotta roofed buildings on either side. Smaller shacks + tents take up space in the central concourse. Puffs of greasy cooking smoke. Random things strung up between buildings: laundry, shards of colored glass, rusted helmets. Some houses have boats strung on the outside railing of the bridge
- Urchins running on the street, stray dogs. People cooking in the street on coal stoves. A forlorn ministrel tooting at a pan flute. Tough looking men and women sharpening weapons.
- How do you go about finding Ersatz? Leave space for PC’s criminal contacts

Giselle’s
- Cinnabar working on the grouting of one of the nicer, 3 story buildings (whitewashed and painted with flowers)
    - Lives + works in Bridgetown, maintaining the masonry
    - Not the best pay, but there’s always a lot of work from random arson attempts. Someday he’ll get out of here and get on a nice project with the city - there’s talk from the merchants of re-engineering the river
- Giselle chases out a ferrety looking, ragged little man (Usha/Mushika) with a hatpin - tell him to stop bothering her girls

Ersatz the Crook
- Residency is a top floor on a building. Where the war council meets, so to speak. Close quarters, cluttered with knickknacks. Window overlooking the river, other bridges in distance.
- Offers finest imported coffee (hot brown water with bits of sticks), any of his specialty wares
    - tin + glass jewelry (20gp), heavy jade stone dice that always roll double ones (5gp),  legendary cursed mask of anksara, paintings
    - one of the PC's aura is haunted, offers an exorcism
- Asks where the misurium shipment is, would like it back
	- open to negotiating - can sell the ores for them, for a 50% cut (300gp)
- Gangs have suffered a chain of recent blows, suspect a rat - a Duke’s secretary they bought out has been caught, planned burglaries encountered guards, black market dealers they buy from have been taken out
- Ersatz believes the room has to be secure, but that one of his close associates may have betrayed him. There’s information that has only been discussed in this room that has been leaked.
- He only talks to a few people that regularly: his guard Basta, the goblin Merriwink, the lady Giselle
- Investigation:
    - walls are thick - seems like solid stone. Low chances of anyone eavesdropping thru floors/walls
    - some papers in drawer, but less than you would expect for a crimelord - the Bridgetowners do most planning by word
    - an abandoned bathtub on the near bank, with a figure inside (Sophia)
    - traces of vermin (holes in the wall, animal scat)

The Bent Knuckle
- Group of goblins playing [King and his Men](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/srt477/the_king_and_his_men_another_mini_game_for_your/)
- Cinnabar is there - talking about taking employment from merchers
- Clockwork waltzes in. Orders orange juice + milk.
    - Friendly conversation, special interest in Kallista, ask if they ever see any other tieflings in Kevara
    - Abrasive, make fun of some people
    - The Bridgetowners are all going under sooner than they think - Cinnabar is smart to try and get out early
    - Leaves when his guards find him (tho the Bridgers will be upset abt merchers being there)

### The Merrow
Sophia
- Initially friendly, then very suspicious if they say they know Vasilev or Cinnabar
- Thinks they're just going to interrogate Cinnabar, but the other merrow are less friendly
- Little bit of an outsider amongst other merrow

Something else breaks bad, conflict with/pulls in merrow
- Fight aboard punts on the rivers, merrow try to pull them in
- Shallowpriest: nerf to 60hp, 1 lvl3 slot
	- Starts w concentration on hold person on Cinnabar - starts drowning at start of battle
	- First round cast mirror image
	- Old crone Ezra also wanted to capture Cinnabar to force him to redo her sitting room
- Merrow: new yorker accents. try to pull the PCs into the water
	- if talked to Sophia > she's reluctant to fight, but gets ordered by mother in law Ezra
- Basta manning the boat, make DC13 str/dex checks each round to direct boat / not get pulled downriver (move 10ft + rotate)
- [Underwater Combat](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/38d5st/drowning_checks_in_5e/)
    - Disadv + resistance for non piercing melee. Ranged weapons do not work except crossbow.
    - Swim check each round to not get swept 5ft downriver + sink 5ft
    - If fighting, survive CON score / 2 rounds before drop to 0hp
    - Verbal spellcasting takes 2 * spell lvl + 1 rounds of breath

Post Battle
- Go to a grotto the mermaids use - actually a disused sewage tunnel leading into the river
- Feldspar told some merrow to capture Cinnabar, that he is the one selling info to a rival mercher Greentides
	- obviously doesn't check out - the misurium shipment was trapped, so Giltstern also knew abt the Bridgers' plans. this means Feldspar is likely involved in the spying himself, was trying to misdirect the Bridgers
- Cinnabar is not a real Bridgetowner because he has a real business in the city, has been promised work contracts w merchers to dredge + re-engineer the river for commerce
    - Merrow know Cinnabar works for Vasilev, assumes V has betrayed them
- Ersatz shows up
	- heals some ppl 
	- threaten Ezra - the bridges are not under Kevaran rule, but they are not under merrow rule either. 
- Long rest maybe?
	- Ersatz: the world's not going to blow up overnight, take it easy
	- they can chill at tavern first

### The Inventor

- Next day: Konrad Luca gets in contact with them (how?) tells them to go to his lab for something important
	- call them if they got his number
	- "you guys seem helpful in a pinch - I'm new in town and didn't know who else to call, but I know that the city guard is in the pockets of the merchers. You said you would recover the misurium shipments, but something much more urgent has come up, something that might be a very immediate danger to the city's population"

Luca Industries, Incorporated
- When they arrive: shirtsleeves rolled up, leaning over a ledger book, talking to a female dark skinned elf 
	- telling lab tech Saranna they might soon be pressed for money, he might have to let her go - has two months of savings that he can send her off with
	- Worried that investors will pull the plug after losing last shipment of misurium - production will be halted for several months
	- Put all of his savings into this - on closer inspection, his jacket is fraying and patched
	- Would have taken on bluemoon as assistant, but they're about to lose their budget
- Giltstern just made an order of his Type alpha prototypes from him, they got shipped out early this morning
	- Just heard from Feldspar that theyre going to be "modified" by a guest consultant with Luca Industries - for battle
	- entirely against his original wishes - they're using science to inflict violence
	- this is not going to be good for the image of Luca Industries
- what does he want the pcs to actually do?

### Finding Feldspar

Encounter that: ties in the Fray, also includes Konrad + clockwork

Fray-tide moves in
- Feldspar is leaving on one of the giltstern trading galleons - need to get to him before it leaves
	- time limited encounters  - do a clock, lose time with each failure?
	- if they don't find him, Luca or Clockwork have info
- Statues switch from standing w hand raised to pointing out to sea, then to winching up the nets
- Magic nets get winched up from the statues, seawalls go up - hard to get places
- Encounters past the walls: magic gets unreliable, a weak wraith
	- TODO: what else??
- Ships hurry up to ship out or pull in after the announcement - dockworkers being pushed to load up a galleon and get it out ahead of the Fray coming in
	- 

Go to Feldspar (where? his nice apt? workplace?)
- Need to do a task in order to gain audience (or power force thru)
	- get something from clockwork or luca
	- supervise the ship being loaded ahead of the fray - guard against unrest
	- Feldspar sends them on a wild goose chase, only to buy time to set bombs on the bridge
- Feldspar is taking tea with Luca?
- Feldspar is hosting Clockwork in his apt > confronts them, potential fight
- Merchants are confused why a tiefling with the seals of the Iron Magistrates have arrived in Kevara, but they don’t want to turn down an opportunity to plunder the treasures of Apostasy
- Mushika complaining that Feldspar's bosses won't pay him enough to rent a room - he's getting cold from sleeping in the gutters. Feldspar says they can't have him risking a trail
- Show Feldspar to be genuinely vicious
    - friendly, smiling, playboy
    - reveals that Clockwork is going after Indira (Kallista)?


### Battle on the Bridge

- merchants plan to take out the Bridgers once and for all by blowing up the bridges
- All bridgefolk are stunned from automata shockwave
- Mushika (as rat) has planted mines on the underside of bridge
    - Mines are Clockwork’s invention
    - give him a bomb also?
- Fight across the bridge to chase Mushika, who holds the detonator
	- either X rounds until detonation, or until Mushika gets to the other side
- Automata contracted from Luca Industries hold the bridge, have pinned down all the Bridgefolk
    - Have already used up their Shockwave attk
