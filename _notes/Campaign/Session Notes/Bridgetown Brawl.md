# Background

Spy is wererat Mushika (Two-Penny), new in town after the unrest in Baldur’s Gate
- has been spying as a rat crawling in the walls

hint at: cult, elysian fog, avizallo trade
make it a problem that kallista is lying to party - sow conflict

# Scenes

### Strong Start

PCs have been free for a few weeks, ask what they’ve been up to

3am, the sound of a click-BANG heard from the street outside Ass Place
- Darkness except for a torch (20ft light) mounted on carriage
- A large, covered wooden carriage drawn by 4 horses careening down the cobblestones. Front door opened, a guard standing next to driver is wrestling with a long haired dwarf. Behind the carriage, a gang of three people running behind, trying to grab onto the back of the carriage. Further back in the road, a black scorch mark with two people lying unconscious
- Carriage moves 30ft on guard’s initiative
- Basta wrestles an explosive away from guard and chucks at enemies (PCS or horses) - DC 14 dex save in 10ft radius for 2d6 fire damage
- Thieves will try to wrestle open back loading door - also trapped with an explosive (10ft radius beyond the carriage)
- Tumble out: crate of metal ore, silvery-gold metal in round or teardrop shaped crystals
    - Elf’s tears / misurium from moonflower mines
- Tumble out: 2 ineffective automata, branded Luca Industries
    - Take some damage from bandits > shockback to stun
    - sort of humanoid, treads on bottom, long forklike arms
    - “greetings - would you require - assistance with that - object?”
- Bandits will run if hurt enough

Post battle
- Feldspar + Konrad Luca show up to clean up
    - recognizes Kallista from their date - why’d she never call him back?
    - was a shipment meant for Giltstern
    - never used to see filth on the streets several years ago - things are going under these days (sideways remark on vasilev enabling gang activity, it’s undemocratic)
- Konrad Luca: human man, 30s, patched coat but neatly dressed
    - affable, extremely ambitious
- happen to finish at the steps of Manor Vasilev: V comes out, comments on the blood on doorstep, beckons them in

### Mission Assignment

Setting: Manor Vasilev
- Takes up nearly half a block. Narrow, gothic building of dark gray stone, lots of ornamental stonework. Dark oak door set into a deep portico. Wrought iron gate, finely manicured yard. Half wild, black peacocks perch among the gables.
- Silk wallpaper, furnishings are expensive but have an air of disuse. A number of footmen stand silently in intervals, dressed in black + indigo livery.
- Up a spiral staircase into the tower office
- Office looks the most used. Comparatively spartan. Large black oak desk strewn with papers. Bookshelf behind, cabinet holds a bottle of whisky.
- Up in his high tower office, you can see almost all of kevara - the river moves in a slow silty sludge, crisscrossed by bridges, all the way to the harbor where even now there's the glow of firelight on water as ships load and unload into harbor - bringing grain and textiles and spices to supply the hundreds of city states along the leuchroic coast. across the strait you can just barely see the lights of Kevara's sister city, where you can imagine the monumental statues of Kevar and Arda facing each other across the water. Beyond that, to the north -- nothing. Just the white nothingness of the Fray. You catch a glimpse of a map pinned to the office wall, showing the Leuchroic sea and its surrounds - Kevara-Arda looks so small on it. [show the map]

Vasilev gives mission to find a spy amongst Bridgetown gangs and deliver to the gang leader Ersatz
- Dismisses a page boy - the Rutherfords have not been paying the correct tithe. Numbers on pages 4-12 are clearly fabricated; Mrs Rutherford takes Langska orange blossom in her tea and there’s no possibility they’re affording that with this income.
- Salt codes to tap stonespeak within Giltstern trading firm
    - Complicated contraption on desk - stone of farspeech mounted atop an engraved disk
    - A snake within Bridgetown, code named Twopenny - will compromise V’s position with Bridgetown if cannot eliminate merchant interference
    - Some sort of “guest” from faraway, but V has not heard of anything
- Caution: Bridgetown is extralegal. PCs will not have protection from the law or Duke V
- Potential background about: gangs, relation w landed elite, bridgetown, treaty of the six cups
    - Gangs loot trade barges coming up river (w help from merrow), have been persistent annoyance to merchants
- Part of an alliance made with the gangs - they will supply Vasilev money for future plans (upcoming election)
- They can start at Shoewater bridge and meet Ersatz
- Pay: 600gp
- What are they doing about Basta? still tied up in apartment (awake by now)
    - still drunk - don’t call pamela

### Investigation in Bridgetown

Setting: Shoewater
- Shady part of the city, narrow roads and tightly crammed apartments. River is wide and sluggish, greasy brown-green. Smell of briny algae with an undercurrent of sewage.
- The banks all along the river are built up high, so that trading galleons can fit under the bridges
- The largest of the extralegal bridges, and the first. Wide stone bridge with terracotta roofed buildings on either side. Smaller shacks + tents take up space in the central concourse. Puffs of greasy cooking smoke. Random things strung up between buildings: laundry, shards of colored glass, rusted helmets. Some houses have boats strung on the outside railing of the bridge
- Urchins running on the street, stray dogs. People cooking in the street on coal stoves. A forlorn ministrel tooting at a pan flute. Tough looking men and women sharpening weapons.
- How do you go about finding Ersatz? Leave space for PC’s criminal contacts

Giselle’s
- Cinnabar working on the grouting of one of the nicer, 3 story buildings (whitewashed and painted with flowers)
    - Lives + works in Bridgetown, maintaining the masonry
    - Not the best pay, but there’s always a lot of work from random arson attempts. Someday he’ll get out of here and get on a nice project with the city - there’s talk from the merchants of re-engineering the river
- Giselle chases out a ferrety looking, ragged little man (Usha/Mushika) with a hatpin - tell him to stop bothering her girls

Ersatz the Crook
- Residency is a top floor on a building. Where the war council meets, so to speak. Close quarters, cluttered with knickknacks. Window overlooking the river, other bridges in distance.
- Offers finest imported coffee (hot brown water with bits of sticks), any of his specialty wares
    - tin + glass jewelry (20gp), heavy jade stone dice that always roll double ones (5gp),  legendary cursed mask of anksara, paintings
    - one of the PC's aura is haunted, offers an exorcism
- Asks where the misurium shipment is, would like it back
	- open to negotiating - can sell the ores for them, for a 50% cut (300gp)
- Gangs have suffered a chain of recent blows, suspect a rat - a Duke’s secretary they bought out has been caught, planned burglaries encountered guards, black market dealers they buy from have been taken out
- Ersatz believes the room has to be secure, but that one of his close associates may have betrayed him. There’s information that has only been discussed in this room that has been leaked.
- He only talks to a few people that regularly: his guard Basta, the goblin Merriwink, the lady Giselle
- Investigation:
    - walls are thick - seems like solid stone. Low chances of anyone eavesdropping thru floors/walls
    - some papers in drawer, but less than you would expect for a crimelord - the Bridgetowners do most planning by word
    - an abandoned bathtub on the near bank, with a figure inside (Sophia)
    - traces of vermin (holes in the wall, animal scat)

The Bent Knuckle
- Group of goblins playing [King and his Men](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/srt477/the_king_and_his_men_another_mini_game_for_your/)
- Cinnabar is there - talking about taking employment from merchers
- Clockwork waltzes in. Orders orange juice + milk.
    - Friendly conversation, special interest in Kallista, ask if they ever see any other tieflings in Kevara
    - Abrasive, make fun of some people
    - The Bridgetowners are all going under sooner than they think - Cinnabar is smart to try and get out early
    - Leaves when his guards find him (tho the Bridgers will be upset abt merchers being there)

### The Merrow
Sophia
- Initially friendly, then very suspicious if they say they know Vasilev or Cinnabar
- Thinks they're just going to interrogate Cinnabar, but the other merrow are less friendly
- Little bit of an outsider amongst other merrow

Something else breaks bad, conflict with/pulls in merrow
- Read aloud
	- You have just watched your ally, Toby, get pierced through the shoulder by a harpoon and pulled into the water; he's floating motionless a few inches below the water. Your boat rocks violently from the aftershock as merfolk circle. Toby's blood rises dark and inky to the surface - he is in very serious danger.  Cinnabar, the red dragonborn, has been pushed under the oily slick of the river surface as the merrow shallowpriest mutters arcane sigils. 
- Fight aboard punts on the rivers, merrow try to pull them in
- Shallowpriest: old lady named Ezra. nerf to 60hp, 1 lvl3 slot
	- Starts w concentration on hold person on Cinnabar - can hold breath for 7 rounds
	- First round cast mirror image
- Merrow: new yorker accents. try to pull the PCs into the water
	- if talked to Sophia > she's reluctant to fight, but gets ordered by mother in law Ezra
	- PCs managed to persuade Sophia to leave fight
- Basta manning the boat, make DC13 str/dex checks each round to direct boat / not get pulled downriver (move 30ft + rotate)
	- Players can use action to row and add 10ft 
- [Underwater Combat](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/38d5st/drowning_checks_in_5e/)
    - Disadv + resistance for non piercing melee. Ranged weapons do not work except crossbow.
    - Swim check each round to not get swept 5ft downriver + sink 5ft
    - If fighting, survive CON score / 2 rounds before drop to 0hp
    - Verbal spellcasting takes 2 * spell lvl + 1 rounds of breath

Post Battle
- Go to a grotto the mermaids use - actually a disused sewage tunnel leading into the river
- Feldspar told some merrow to capture Cinnabar, that he is the one selling info to a rival mercher Greentides
	- obviously doesn't check out - the misurium shipment was trapped, so Giltstern also knew abt the Bridgers' plans. this means Feldspar is likely involved in the spying himself, was trying to misdirect the Bridgers
	- give them a lead to the docks! draw all the bridgetowners out of the bridges to investigate something, get trapped behind the fray shroud, then strike
- Sophia: first got in contact with a blue dragonborn along the coast - north side of town, past the warehouses
	- was standing on the deck of that old, half sunken trading ship
	- seemed startled to be found, then gave contact info and said he had important info for merrow
	- but why was he at the shipwreck?
- Ezra: Cinnabar is not a real Bridgetowner because he has a real business in the city, has been promised work contracts w merchers to dredge + re-engineer the river for commerce
    - Merrow know Cinnabar works for Vasilev, assumes V has betrayed them
    - Wanted to capture Cinnabar to force him to redo her sitting room
- Ersatz shows up
	- heals some ppl 
	- threaten Ezra - the bridges are not under Kevaran rule, but they are not under merrow rule either. 
- Long rest maybe?
	- Ersatz: the world's not going to blow up overnight, take it easy
	- they can chill at tavern first


### The Inventor

- Next day: Konrad Luca gets in contact with them (how?) tells them to go to his lab for something important
	- call them if they got his number
	- "you guys seem helpful in a pinch - I'm new in town and didn't know who else to call, but I know that the city guard is in the pockets of the merchers. You said you would recover the misurium shipments, but something much more urgent has come up, something that might be a very immediate danger to the city's population"

Luca Industries, Incorporated
- read aloud
	- An old brick factory building in the working class neighborhood of Kerrigan's End. A warehouse door on one end is open; there is a very well appointed carriage in orange and blue livery parked in front
	- gleaming chrome and brass machinery, a small engine hums with a faint blue glow. A top of the line crystal arcanographer
- When they arrive: Konrad Luca is speaking to a mustachioed lord (Duke Filroy)
	- Duke: unfortunate, i say, really unfortunate that you lost that last shipment! Had hoped better from you, my boy, when I put my faith and money in you - you say that will set you back for how long?
	- Konrad: Two months sir, and I do apologize, but if I were to have just enough gold to make up for the lost raw materials, then I could have production of the prototypes back on schedule with only a small delay -
	- Duke: nonsense my boy! Whatever happened some good old elbow grease and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps? 
	- Put all of his savings into this - on closer inspection, his jacket is fraying and patched
	- Might have to tell his lab tech she'll be out of work for a while. Would have taken on bluemoon as assistant, but they're about to lose their budget
- Shockback triggers when he goes to fiddle with an automata some more
- Giltstern just made an order of his Type alpha prototypes from him, they got shipped out early this morning
	- Just heard from Feldspar that theyre going to be "modified" by a guest consultant with Luca Industries - for battle
	- entirely against his original wishes - they're using science to inflict violence
	- this is not going to be good for the image of Luca Industries
- Konrad can't do anything legally to stop them, because Giltstern already owns the goods. Wants the PCs to do damage control - figure out what the automata are being used for, try to stop anything really bad from happening
	- doesn't have much money to pay them back with - offer to owe them a favor
	- Give them something to resist the electric surges? a capacitor to prevent the stun effects
- Maybe ask them why they're in the city - there's better employ for adventurers out in the wild
	- warn them about Vasilev
- Automata were ordered to the northside docks, where Clockwork made the modifications


### The Shipwreck

Going to investigate
- Ersatz, Merriwink, Basta 2 other Bridgers (bandit stats) come with 
- Basta and Merriwink snipe at each other - Ersatz reminds Basta what they said about threatening children
- How do they get to the docks?
- A siren starts wailing, its sound cast high over the spires. The statue moves, pointing NNE out to sea. A Fray-tide is coming in.
- Foreman rushing dockworkers to load up the ships, set out before the Tide gets in. Panicky dockworkers carrying goods to the ship, one of them crashes into another and falls painfully - she doesn't say anything and picks back up
- Past the warehouses - low slung, utilitarian buildings. Some of these used to be plague houses back in the day.

The old trading galleon
- An old wreck of a ship, half-moored against the stone pier. Wooden planks gray and splintered, jutting into the air like old bones. The ship lists sharply towards its back, partially sunken. Sound of water lapping on wood.
- Hole in the side of the hull, abt 10 ft down - goes to Cargo Deck
- Ersatz, some other bandits offer to keep watch - others will split out into a diff route

Ship's Deck
- One mast has fallen down and bisected the deck, falling on top of the forecastle - the normal entrance to below decks is crushed in
- Deck is steeply slanted to the back of the ship, where the whole back quarter of the ship is submerged
- Standing at the high point on the prow, you can see further off the coast. The water is a deep blue until about a mile out, where it suddenly transitions into a blank, milky whiteness. Thick white mist is continually evaporating from its surface, rising high into the air like a stormfront. The fog has already drifted low over land, hanging in a low layer that obscures the tops of the ship's masts. 
- Stairs on the prow side goes to Galley
Galley
- Picked over by animals, a number of smaller interconnected rooms
- Muffled bang and a curse below
- Door below stairs set with a a large clock, wires going off of it connecting out of the room and to a lever nearby. Hands of the watch are set to 60
	- The moment they touch the doorknob something clicks, the walls start rumbling, there's a horrible grinding sound and the sloshing of water. The hands start ticking downwards, from 60 seconds down...
	- Hitting the lever resets it
	- Letting it count to 0 unlocks the door, a puff of confetti sproings out of the clock face
Gun Deck
- Where Clockwork modified the automata
- Cavernous space, rows of cannons lining the two sides. The soft drip of water. Several cannons have been opened up and emptied of gunpowder
- Gutted remains of a few automata - shockback effect if they approach
- Springs, clockwork mechanisms - these look like they were made by a different hand, diff materials
- Heavy door at the back end with a lock in the center. The officers of this ship were afraid of their underlings
Cargo deck / brig
- Dark, rotting ropes and hammocks. Sailors' belongings + clothes strewn about, abandoned in a hurry
- A clunk - the sound of a footstep somewhere above
- Stairs upwards are submerged, there's a water elemental trying to get back out to sea (???)
	- spits out the key
Captain's Cabin
- Spacious cabin with a large desk, recessed bed. Curtains around the bed have been torn down, the curtain rod is slanting towards the ground. Clockwork is sprawled across the top of the desk, Feldspar is standing in front
- Windows boarded up, this room is on the back end of the ship + entirely underwater
- Feldspar: telling Clockwork to stay put. He's already been enough of a headache for Feldspar's masters, given how much they're humoring him. And really, won't it be counterproductive to his goals once it gets out that there's a fugitive tiefling running around Kevara?
	- Clockwork: not a fugitive, I told you. And what's the point in going on vacation if you can't sightsee?
	- Feldspar: they're running me raw doing all this babysitting... first the rat, and now you?
	- Clockwork: did you like my housewarming additions upstairs? I was getting so bored of just opening boring normal doors...
- Merchants are confused why a tiefling with the seals of the Iron Magistrates have arrived in Kevara, but they don’t want to turn down an opportunity to plunder the treasures of Apostasy
- Mushika complaining that Feldspar's bosses won't pay him enough to rent a room - he's getting cold from sleeping in the gutters. Feldspar says they can't have him risking a trail
- Feldspar reveals that Mushika + automata have already gone to Bridgetown to blow up the bridges
	- Who would notice? After all, those bridges are already teeming with vermin - oh, and also a lot of rats
	- It's a surprise that no one else has gone and done it already, really. It's high time we cleaned up some of the filth in this city. 
- Show Feldspar to be genuinely vicious
    - friendly, smiling, playboy
    - reveals that Clockwork is going after Indira (Kallista)?
- Sirens suddenly pick up again, this time changing rhythm and tenor - Feldspar laughs they had better get going
	- Feldspar + clockwork click on masks

Back to the Bridge
- The fog has gotten much closer, you can see it rolling in across the sea with alarming speed. White water of the Fray ebbs and swirls like milk poured into coffee
- The statue of Kevar has changed again - it's bent down, both arms dragging something up. A shimmering golden net is trailing from its hands, and you realize the net stretches all the way across the docks. What you thought was a drainage groove 200 feet in front of you has opened up, the net being slowly drawn out from it. 
- The fog rolls in - it swallows up the shipwreck instantly, and you can't see it at all
- Skill challenge: 3 successes to make it in time, 3 failures and the bandits sacrifice themselves to push the players over the net
	- Running with the fog 20 feet behind your heels, something shrieks within it - a wraith reaches out (specter stats)
	- Breathing in the fog, your chest seizes up + magic abilities fail
	- Back towards the warehouses - a crane swinging out of the way of the net, panicked horses pulling crates, crowd of remaining dockworkers running for shelter, foreman screaming at them
	- Climb over the rising net
- Past the net - with a jerk, it springs up the rest of the way as the statue brings its arm level with its shoulder. The shroud now stretches 500 feet into the air, it's weave made of some sort of dense metallic fiber. The fog surges in, crashing into the net with a force that actually makes it bulge inwards and strain - but it holds. 
- How do they try to get across the city back to the bridges?
- If any bandits made it with them, have another phalanx of automata come out to engage them


### Battle on the Bridge

- merchants plan to take out the Bridgers once and for all by blowing up the bridges
- All bridgefolk are stunned from automata shockwave
- Mushika (as rat) has planted mines on the underside of bridge
    - Mines are Clockwork’s invention
- Fight across the bridge to chase Mushika, who holds the detonator
	- mushika takes dash as long as no one is in melee. Disengage if caught?
	- automata chase + block, range + melee. Some on roofs (half move to jump down)
	- what do automata do when mushika dies?
- Automata contracted from Luca Industries hold the bridge, have pinned down all the Bridgefolk
    - Have already used up their Shockwave attk
- Make it clear that mushika will detonate when he gets to other side of bridge. The goal in combat is not always to straight up kill all the opponents
	- explosion is 4d6 dmg - DEX / STR save to jump off the side of the bridge for half dmg or fall dmg
- Notes for players
	- Eletha - step of the wind lets you take a 3rd movement
- lycanthropy risk - if infected?
	- make that first night a full moon
	- periodic WIS save to lose control and transform, always loses control on full moon > control goes to DM
	- immunities only while transformed
	- while transformed - no casting, lose proficiency on attacks
	- find someone to cast remove curse

Fail State (bridge blows up)
- roll to see if important npcs die
- Vasilev loses ground - Luca or dukes start digging into her background. Try to take away her council seat, take away her ownership (player's ownership) of the house. 
- Luca gains power - merchers, nobles buy into his company. Luca may start offering adventurers jobs instead. Vasilev may be pissed if players agree and she finds out.
