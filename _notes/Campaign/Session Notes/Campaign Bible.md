# World

Innistere: sea between two continents. crater created by cataclysm explosion

Sutherlands: collection of lands south of Kevara-Arda

## Baldur’s Gate & the desert

Baldur’s Gate: big trading city on the edge of the desert. Start of the overland trade route from the ocean (via Kevara river) towards the westerlands.

Desert is the site of an ancient catastrophe (thousands of years ago). Parts of the desert are still crystallized glass from whatever blasted the landscape.

## Avizallo: The Court of Birds

A series of glass columns in the ocean. Remnants of an ancient explosion. Subtropical clime, birds nest on the glass towers

Lots of craft, artificing, artisans. Some really good magical institutions

owl (religion), gyrfalcon (guard/navy), raven (law enforcement), vulture, macaw, kingfisher (commerce), osprey, crane, hummingbird,

Guard wear half hawk masks; lower public servants wear half sparrow masks

- Would like to steal trade from Kevara-Arda, resents their naval prominence
- Settled several hundred yrs ago by coastal ppls fleeing the inland empire, the fray - legends that they were led by migrating birds to the columns
- Height generally protects from incursions of the fray, with a few prominent exceptions (what killed Bluemoon’s dad)
- Patron god: the birds (collective whole seen as mouthpiece of a force)
- big sport - bird fighter kites

## Kevara-Arda: World’s Gate

A huge, old city state that has seen many different rulers and ages. Most trade goes through here. Layers upon layers of different architectural styles, religions.

Kevara is the larger, western peninsula, situated near river delta. Arda is the slightly smaller eastern peninsula

- Statues: frame the strait, founders Kevar and Arda. Locals navigate by the angle of the shadow - eg. at the 9 o’clock shadow
- other unique features TODOOO
- Trade comes up the muddy river thru Kevara

Districts:

- Bridgetown: a series of covered bridges thru the river, technically extralegal territory. Where people go to flee the law.
    - Bridge names: Shoewater, Grimslet, Bongdrop, Widdle-Over-Shine
    - Vasilev + PCs based nearby on Shades Lane
    - Treaty of the Six Cups: when merrow first started settling in the river, the patrician a few hundred years ago tried to threaten them to leave, met with a representative of the merrow. Drank five cups of poisoned wine - representative withheld antidote in the sixth cup until patrician agreed to the treaty. Allow merchant boats up river at set limits + schedules, not exceeding a certain depth. Allow merrow to live in river. Stated anyone living on river territory was not under city jurisdiction; excluded houseboats but forgot bridges.
    - Bridges were originally for covered shops, but were forcefully taken over
- The Docks + Merchants’ Row: wealthy core of the trade business.
- Little Gardha: originally a dwarvish neighborhood, now home to many races of small folk. Can be hard to navigate for tallmen
- Catacombs, Temple District, Patrician’s Hill

Factions

- Established government: Patrician Bacrust + Dukes. Mostly incompetent, work to protect own investments in trade and property. Dukes are hereditary, Patrician is elected.
- Merchants: rich trading companies with strong lobbying power. Financially back most politicians
    - Giltstern: one of the most powerful companies, led by Isaiah Giltstern
    - Tend to exploit working class: long hours/low wages for dock workers, sell vital goods to city at high prices
- The Technic: new entrepreneur technocracy led by Konrad Luca. Threat to Merchants and Dukes.
    - Aggressively growth oriented, work to acquire / displace multiple economic sectors (education, various guilds, governance) by using automata
    - Somehow polluting the river
- Crime: those pushed to the margins. Gang power is relatively weak in the city. Theft, mercenaries, extortion. Sometimes allied w Merrow
- Merrow: generally antagonistic towards landfolk, for dumping garbage in water and bringing very deep trade ships up river
    - Descended from outcasted ocean merrow
- Guilds: crafts/artisan groups. Bards, jewelers, etc. Often buy/sell things from merchants.
- Religion: fragmented and diverse
- The automata council: competing with Luca

Conflicts/Threats

- Upcoming election
    - Current Patrician Nutterwoll is old, somewhat incompetent. Probably die/assassinated soon
    - Next election is in 2 years, scheming has begun
    - Only those with a valid citizenship card can vote
    - Invalidating of ballots, voting multiple times, bribery + coercion
    - Konrad Luca will try to vote
- Elven encroachment: Moonflower and Shrewseer estates are both separately trying to weaken Kevara. Would like direct trade access to East + South.
    - Largely acting covertly, have spies within upper classes
    - May work to sway the election

## The Mirwood

Old, deep forest. Primarily ruled by wood elves, divided into territories (estates) - however, there are also many parts which are independent.

Old god - the green man, cancerous overflowing growth

Interests:

- conflicts with non elf coastal settlements (Kevara-Arda) over deforestation
- would like to see other city states populated with elven / elven sympathetic governments - build a protective sphere around mirwood

  

Moonflower Estate:

- One of the most prominent, Eletha’s old home
- Shelters for orphans / underserved residents are actually labor camps to mine precious ores deep within the forest
- The Moonflower espirans sell ore (elf’s tears, misurium) to other elven estates (including the Shrewseers, family of Eletha’s childhood friend) - the lucrative business deal gets them a lot of espirae, as does their exploitation of the orphans

  

About elves:

- Lifespan varies by social class: 150 yrs for lower class up to 1000 for highest class
- Espirae: the sort of magical energy that gives elves their lifespan
    - Nature is largely unknown, except that it is generated through the social contracts between elves (and to a lesser extent, elves and non-elves)
- Highly stratified society where everyone reports to an Espiran (lord, referred as sir/dame)
    - Lower elves swear covenants (magical oaths) to their superiors, which generates a lot of espirae for the lord and a little for the peon
    - Espirae is also generated through other sorts of covenants - eg. business agreements

## Apostasy & the Hellmouth

A long rift into the crust of the earth, leagues deep. At the bottom of the rift lies the Hellmouth, where magma continuously bubbles from the fires of hell - this is a place where the boundary between planes is thin. Tieflings and other beings of infernal origin have built a kingdom in the upper reaches of the canyon - iron bridges and spires span the great gap, and dwelling places with intricate facades are carved directly into the rock walls. Ruled by the Iron Magistrates, arbiters of justice, order, law, and punishment.

Located far to the west, past the desert and more. Little of the rest of the world knows where the Hellmouth is - some legends say it’s in a volcano in the sea, some say its far to the north. Many agree that it’s a land of fantastical engineering and jeweled riches.

- Lawyers / judges are warlocks who consult devils of the infernal plane - on how to interpret infernal laws, powers to mete punishment, drawing up magical contracts, creating new laws
- Laws are just a very extensive magical contract housed in the infernal plane - all citizens are sworn by blood to it
- Extreme rule of law, very little crime

## Langksa: The Inland Empire

Primarily human / orcish, an empire in its waning years. Highlands and plains, some forest.

Langksara: capital, built on the site of an ancient whalefall on a lake, floating gardens

History + Culture

- Orcish clans are usually matrilineal
- Empire began in a political wedding between the orc + human leaders of the area > current half orc royal bloodline
- Once a sprawling empire that controlled most of the map - has declined in the past 100 years, now mostly in the highlands. Coastline remains fragmented in city states in the wake.
- some sort of worship tied to the whales idk, circle of life

## Candlekeep

Lies on open territory along the coast

- Crestrim: nearby town, Blind Dragonet

## Other Places

- Isle of Piranesi - automata labyrinth
    - Luca Piranesi (mage) studied the creation of automatons, was the only one to ever create a fully realized intelligence
    - Created the automaton to guard his notes, aid him in further research
    - Did bad experiments on her, refused to recognize her contributions
    - Imprisoned in the labyrinth because he feared her power
    - ultimately killed by the automata
- Undersea jellyfish city (maybe bluemoon’s dad is from here?)
