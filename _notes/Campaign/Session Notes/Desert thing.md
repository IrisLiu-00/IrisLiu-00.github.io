# Strong Start

Journey into the desert to explore some ruins/tomb with Nidalia, Theryn, Korvala

a moving sandstorm that crystallizes into a settlement

oasis

desert is populated by shards and flats of red glass, from some past apocalypse

fight other lamias from nidalia’s litter - theyve been corrupted / mindwiped somehow?

maybe they turn into black cats when they die, but that might reveal the fistandia connection too soon

some evil force / enemy faction, connected to vasilev + heist somehow

finding out more about freyot’s stuff leads into the elven estates?

Rulla’s shop is now a thriving weeb store (thanks to financing from Vasilev)

Game elements: exploration (a bit), puzzles (more), fights, rp (lower?), some sort of mystery

use battlemap, initiative tracker

other marauding adventurers are a threat

Nidalia: woke up alone in the desert 5 years ago, taken in by Amberdunes
- lower body - an all black panther
- created by Freyot using a kitten from one of Fistandia’s cats
- Freyot was imprisoned by the mage council because they thought he was getting too close to the secret of the labyrinth
- she has to follow a cryptic set of rules imposed by freyot
- some sort of post resurrection nerf lets her and amberdunes get captured

Freyot / fistandia
- interested in automata as a novelty - started talking to the council and got close to finding out about Piranesi’s work - council started tailing him - Freyot realized sth was up and went into hiding
- Found the location of Piranesi’s Island - encoded somehow so he didn’t know what was on it
    - info about how the labyrinth is hidden (some sort of riddle/puzzle) - pieces they need to get to the labyrinth or free the automata
    - future: find Freyot’s lab to get info about the labyrinth (based in elven estates? freyot was an elf)
- Created Lamias using a litter of Fistandia’s kittens - lamias got amnesia (how?) when Freyot was killed
- Freyot was travelling in the desert with the lamias, searching in the wrong place for the labyrinth, ambushed by the council

  

informant/questgiver working for the opposition (elves) - Vasilev killed them, poisoned their information
