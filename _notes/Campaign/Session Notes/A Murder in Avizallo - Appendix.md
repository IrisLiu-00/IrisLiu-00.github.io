# Background

## The Conspiracy

Sahuaguin zombie attacks 
- Magical creatures can become undead with some regularity around the Fray - arcane gradient differential causes higher magic concentration just outside the Fray, undead can rise
- Owl arranging attacks to distract from reservoir attack, sow conflict - creating and commanding undead sahuagin
Corrupted Guardians
- Disable Guardians so they won't defend against sahuagin, automata
	- have to show guardians doing their job first
- Systematically bait Guardians with attacks at remote locations at night, then Owl seals them
- Disabled Guardians reduce to their skull, have a spell seal imprinted. 
- Stored in a nook in Eledeia's cove - used the eledeia automata to move them
- Owl was testing her control over guardians some years ago - led to the fray wraith attack that killed Bluemoon's dad
Controlling Automata
- New feature on latest models allows remote control thru a device
	- increased height improves range on the remote signal
- Owl is getting Mettlewise to fly the automata controlling kites at specified locations
	- Mettlewise thinks the kites have surveillance equipment to catch petty crimes - Owl let her think it was her idea, helped develop the equipment
	- some kites also disperse fliers for the temple (could be a good plot hook!)
- Kites have remote device to hijack Eledeia's automata and control them
	- Owl manage to steal a key to Eledeia automata - how? used assassin to break in?
- discreetly transport automata by loading a bunch into cargo container, have one push it around - cargo loading automata are fairly common with the Giltstern crew
	- also use to transport sahuagin in cargo
Reservoir Attacks
- Owl gets more latitude to move after Gyrfalcon taken out
- Planning to systematically take out reservoirs in each column to search for Nexida, weaken Avizallo (need to import water or import Felichian priests)
	- Cisterns are connected to Tensorat's old workshop
- Automata attack from above, sahuagin swim up from below
Owl's relation to giltstern?

## The Murder
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding out she's a false priest, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- ==Gyrfalcon became suspicious bc:
		- guard schedule was shifted around in reservoirs so that there were gaps - gyrfalcon was able to fix
		- number of guardians decreased, response time slowed. specifically around the reservoirs. 
		- found mentions of the Queen of Thieves?
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence between Orin + Gandras
		- Macaw accidentally left one of Orin's letters at the Rookery? Or the temple?
		- Find letter from Gandras in Orin's mailbox, or Owl produces Orin's letter to put PCs on Macaw's trail
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
- somehow incite the riot
	- automata at the riot were actually Kingfisher's
- faked lividity by beating up the body, then plant the body at the site of riot
	- Assassin casted Lightning Arrow to get electrocution burns
# NPCs
