# Background

## The Conspiracy

Sahuagin fray wraith zombies 
- Owl killed a bunch of sahuagin, did a necromancy-adjacent ritual to convert them into fray wraiths
	- vacating the corpse of its natural magic, inviting the fray in
	- resulting wraiths count as Aberrations but have some undead attributes, can be kind of commanded (or do they need to be boxed up and transported?)
- Can leave dead bodies when destroyed, unlike true wraiths. Also look more humanoid, while true wraiths only have a rough impression of a living thing
- Owl using them to sow conflict, attack the reservoir
- Need to be stored in range of Owl's control - in a nook at the back of Eledeia's cove
	- Reduced to their skulls, submerged in water
	- Also need to be replenished relatively often bc they don't keep
Controlling Automata
- New feature on latest models allows remote control thru a device
	- increased height improves range on the remote signal
- Owl is getting Mettlewise to fly the automata controlling kites at specified locations
	- Mettlewise thinks the kites have surveillance equipment to catch petty crimes - Owl let her think it was her idea, helped develop the equipment
	- some kites also disperse fliers for the temple (could be a good plot hook!)
- Valespinner has remote device to hijack Eledeia's automata and control them, disguised as part of a device to distribute leaflets
	- Owl stole one of the automata to synthesize the key. The automata later turned up drowned + damaged.
	- Merriwink paid Myla (featherweight) to install the device. Myla got the aerial leaflet printer as a sample from Auric Trading
- discreetly transport automata by loading a bunch into cargo container, have one push it around - cargo loading automata are fairly common with the Giltstern crew
	- also use to transport sahuagin in cargo
Reservoir Attacks
- Owl gets more latitude to move after Gyrfalcon taken out
- Planning to systematically take out reservoirs in each column to search for Cory's true name, weaken Avizallo (need to import water or import Felichian priests)
	- Cisterns are connected to Tensorat's old workshop
- Use sahuagin to attack bc automata can't go in water
Auric Trading Co.
- Small Kevaran-based trading company - actually a shell company
- Any real shipping they do is contracted out to Giltstern (eg the leaflet printer)
- Registered under Morgana Saire, resident of Kevara-Arda
- Use shell company to requisition cargo crates, use of the freight elevators
- Kevaran Traders guild was tied on whether to provide the government with more funding for naval presence around Avizallo, until Auric trading joined the guild and voted to increase naval presence
- Launder money gained from Giltstern 
	- use money to buy black diamonds - used to resurrect fray wraiths (needs like 300gp per sahuagin)
	- use to pay someone to reverse engineer a key for krystin's automata
- Informed Avizallo gov they were culling sahuagin to clear out a dock for ships - one of the small glass atolls around the isle
	- didn't actually build a dock, owl just went a killed a bunch of sahuagin

## The Murder
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding out she's a false priest, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- Gyrfalcon became suspicious, see clues below
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence between Orin + Gandras
		- Macaw accidentally left one of Orin's letters at the Rookery? Or the temple?
		- Find letter from Gandras in Orin's mailbox, or Owl produces Orin's letter to put PCs on Macaw's trail
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
- Incite the riot by having automata fire into the strikers
	- actually Kingfisher's automata under her control, not Giltstern's
- faked lividity by beating up the body, then plant the body at the site of riot
	- Assassin casted Lightning Arrow to get electrocution burns
