#### The Journey

	- Merriwink calls to give Toby his second task: steal the Valespinner for her, from her "evil" twin Mettlewise
- Scene setting: the departure
	- Josephine calls Iolas - no, Solas to be first watch on the air bubble spell. Steps up to the forehead of the leviathan and rests a hand on its giant horn. A spray of mist ejected from its blowhole - water rains down over the Kevara docks, kids shriek and wave in delight. Solas waves their hands over a giant sigil tattooed on the sea monster's spine, and the saltwater spray hanging in the air collects to form an iridescent membrane around you all. A cheer rises from the pirates as the monster beats its flukes and sinks. 
	- Very low light - a few dark blue rays filter down. Bioluminescent patterns on Atlas' skin light up. Pirates sit down in hammocks strung along the sides, a few climb up long spines for first watch. 
	- Few hours into the ocean, the water above loses all transparency - the milk white of the Fray.
- What do the PCs do for the 3 week journey?
	- Food is unremarkable - hard tack soaked in soup. Iolas amuses the crew by spearing fish with magic missiles
	- Josephine knows the court of birds?

- Water gets shallower, Atlas has to breach. Lots of tiny black glass isles, choked with seagrass.
- Josephine sends crew onto the atolls to hunt for giant rockfish, which come to lay their eggs. but watch out for sahuagin!
	- sahuagin can dive under water if they have extra movement
- Kevaran navy ships patrolling around Avizallo, naval protection as part of the deal. Hostile to most. 
	- details
## Day 1
#### Arrival in the Isle
La Sul
- Scene setting
	- High white vanishing fog of the fray. It clears, and you get a glimpse of a reflection - sunlight on black glass, refracted blue and violet in the morning light. Five pillars rise from the ocean, wreathed by white mist at their base. Small black dots of birds spiralling around the tips.
	- The top of each pillar is crowned with lush greenery, vines and trees. Set amidst them like jewels are multicolored houses. Birds of every sort (gulls, parrots) wheel and deal in the air, raucous squawking.
	- Draw closer - you see the famed saltwood trees, which look nothing much like trees. White fingers claw their way up the base of each pillar, stark contrast with the black translucence. Built amongst the vertically growing shoots are docks, their wood coated a darker color with waterproofing. Ships large and small pull in gingerly between the gnarled, bone-white roots of the trees. All of the ship have the characteristic white hulls of saltwood hewn, deepwater bound vessels. 
	- People at work in the docks, unloading cargo holds to these elevators that travel on rails up the length of the columns. Food and textiles from trading ships into the isle
- Location: La Sul. Bargewrights, ships, Giltstern.
- Josephine has trouble getting water - an official directing ppl to caskets being brought in from the other isles. Fountains r down. 
- Owl chivvying away some Felichian missionaries. Approaches PCs
	- Sporadic fray wraith attacks recently, some saltwood growers injured/killed. Avizallo's own military power isn't great, doesn't fully trust Giltstern either
	- mentioned problems to Vasilev, who said he would send ppl over
	- can show the PCs over to the groves
La Varza, the saltwood groves
- White barked trees, reaching like skeletal fingers above the water. Very few leaves. Lots of roots spider around each other and cling to crevices in the glass. Wooden docks crisscross between the roots. 
- Druids lined up on one of the docks, some of them holding signs: "Kevaran leeches off our backs", "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work", "Gandras Dol, Giltern's puppet"
- Few other citizens standing back and watching (incl Sabra)
- At the front of the line, Gyrfalcon and Gandras. Gandras has a number of automata behind him. 
	- Gandras Dol: tall, brown skinned man. Dressed in a well tailored sleeveless coat, well tailored arms bared. Half laughing, trying to be polite. 
	- Gyrfalcon: You cannot bring those here, Mister Dol. As a civilian you have no right to use armed enforcement against other citizens. 
	- Dol: Come now, shouldn't a man have a right to see to the security of his own private lands? I don't like to do it, but until the situation is resolved, I need some way to prevent damages to my property. Giltstern enterprises has supplied me with a solution. 
	- Gyrfalcon: I will remind you that the saltwood groves are not your land, they have only been leased to you by the court of birds. I will be bringing this to the court, and then we'll see how much longer you can bring this Kevaran scum onto our docks. 
- Giltstern standing on a higher terrace, turns away
- Fray wraiths attack. Gandras will order automata to help fight. 
	- Fray wraiths come in from sea and engage automata, druids, gyrfalcon. As they're distracted another group comes in from the side, going for the civilians
	- they leave dead bodies when killed - unusual for true wraiths
- Opportunity to explore city:
	- La Sul reservoir is non functional
	- Kareem's, Bargewrights. show the kite fights.
	- people: owl, macaw, raven/zora (spying), giltstern
	- have them figure out where they're staying for the night
- Saved Sabra's life, they are now staying at the Dol mansion
- Everyone bought a kite, Sabra and Toby are going to practice
- Went to Bargewrights. 2 Giltstern sailors, starting to talk to Titus. 
	- Titus has a heavy ring on his pinky. Wife Ella comes demanding child support
how to demonstrate automata remote control. show them coming back to roost as they leave?
meet up with owl

#### Riot and Murder
- At evening, Giltstern issued remote order to recall automata - he needs extras to unload a shipment in time
- PCs may or may not be at the saltwood docks - either way Gyrfalcon is on a dock further away
- Riot events (if you ask anyone it's unclear what happened)
	- Gandras/Giltstern ordered automata to stand watch - against wraiths, or potential damage from strikers
	- Some say the riot started bc strikers threw rocks, or bc a wraith was spotted, or the automata just started firing into the crowd
	- Number of workers were killed
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- Tight mask, headwrap slightly loose. Clothing rumpled.  Boot laces are slightly loose (assassin put them on). 
	- Pockets: bit of money
	- Body has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for 500 extra gold. Don't let it go to war. Make the saltwood deal go thru. 
	- Insight check: a little edge of ruthless desperation. Pissed if they weren't at the docks.
- Gyrfalcon cannot be unmasked unless all of the court comes to consensus to remove it
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Court of birds
	- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
	- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
	- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
	- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
	- Raven stays silent
- Signing of saltwood deal is halted
- Titus, some other druids taken for questioning. Ella complains he won't be able to pay child support. Owl breaks them up, steals the ring.

- try to tail him
	- lead to the saltwood groves
- spy on his office

- Clues

	- Gandras keeps the diff saltwood groves separate, in competition - so no one realizes his bad accounting
	- Paper trail on faulty tax breaks

	- reward with info (relevant to both short/long term), some money
- leads: saw kingfisher at the riot, shady accounting from eledeia, it wasn't giltstern's automata at the riot

- coriolis?
- treasure hunt leads: ring is missing (someone can lie), gyrfalcon was investigating sth

	- Titus noticed it missing when they checked him out of questioning at the Rookery
	- Titus thinks his ex wife Ella took it off him to pawn for child support
	- Zora thinks the new adventurers in town might have stolen it, since adventurers are treasure hungry
	- Zora knows the ring is magic from Kareem, a little worried
- leads: kites
	- either Raven trusts them and tells them Merriwink is up to something weird, or Zora says she's investigating sth for Myla?
Danger in the Reservoirs

- tensorat helped engineer a lot of the reservoirs to ...?

- there will be a tournament in a few days time, where Valespinner will by flying
- wining valespinner also gives an advantage to tensorat's labs? passphrases?
Get access to Giltstern's data - infiltrate or fight


each quest should give clear leads on what to do next, don't just let things happen to the pcs

# Treasure
- Loot dropped by owl
	- Ring of mind shielding: a bronzework ring made of intricate woven wires, small green stones set at intervals. The weaving actually makes up magic runes, recognized by Gyrfalcon.
- Loot dropped by assassin
	- crossbow
- gifts from npcs
- [Portable Hole](https://5e.tools/items.html#portable%20hole_dmg): A circular sheet of fine black cloth, 6ft in diameter. Use an action to unfold it against a solid surface, whereupon it creates an extradimensional hole 10ft deep. You can use an action to fold up the hole. Any creatures or objects remain inside the extradimensional space. The folded cloth weighs next to nothing. 

# Scratchpad

- Write down notes as things progress during the game.
