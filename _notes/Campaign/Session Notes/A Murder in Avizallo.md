# Background

## The Murder
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding out she's a false priest, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- ==Gyrfalcon became suspicious bc:
		- reduced guards in the reservoirs
		- found mentions of the Queen of Thieves?
		- 
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence between Orin + Gandras
		- Macaw accidentally left one of Orin's letters at the Rookery? Or the temple?
		- Find letter from Gandras in Orin's mailbox, or Owl produces Orin's letter to put PCs on Macaw's trail
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
- somehow incite the riot
- faked lividity by beating up the body, then plant the body at the site of riot
	- Assassin casted Lightning Arrow to get electrocution burns
- assassin - who is he? is he an avizallan? plant seeds to identity, someone who went missing
	- play them as a [sharpshooter ranger](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1bm3srp/comment/kw9p4mr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)? magic missile crossbow (missilebolt crossbow)?
	- gloomstalker + assassin rogue
## The Councillors

*all insight checks against the Court have disadvantage bc they're masked*
make kingfisher look sus - for the drama! to involve her more

Owl: the mastermind
- if owl asks the PCs to help investigate, why?
- how to expose that she's actually serving Gilead
- Alibi: praying at the temple. corroborated by other priests, templegoers
Raven: parallel investigating
- Alibi: asleep (lie), probably doing some assassins creed shit 
Macaw: unknowing accomplice (how), corrupt, soft/optimistic on kevara
- Alibi: working late in the office (lie), can't say he was actually overseeing at the riots
- Gandras saw Kingfisher at the riot, but Macaw can't say
Vulture: 
- Was the most vocally opposed to gyrfalcon - thought they were further entangling Avizallo with outside world, had upstart ideas about restructuring ownership of saltwood groves
	- Was opposed to them starting from the grading of manuscripts (disliked political opinions in the essays) 
- Alibi: refuse to talk to outsiders? but he was working late in the office, did not see Macaw
Kingfisher: trying to insert her own choice as gyrfalcon's successor? trying to route macaw
- Alibi: was at the site of the riot (conferring with Giltstern earlier). Lie and say she had left by the riot?
- Has purchased a suite of automata for her personal protection
- make her look involved with the conspiracy / any attacking monsters
- Trying to insert her own choice as gyrfalcon's successor - possibly passing old/upcoming exam questions to her protege
	- Sabra Dol? or a stonecutter?
