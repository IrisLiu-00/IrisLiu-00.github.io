## Day 1
Arrival in the Isle
- establish Gyrfalcon's animosity, tensions between saltwood workers + KA mercenaries
- Avizallans blocking Felichian missionaries from entering - maybe Kingfisher lets them come in?
- introduce a few major players of the council
Riot and Murder
- Riot at the saltwood docks - saltwood workers against Gandras Dol's not increasing wages, Giltstern intervened with automata, a number of saltwood growers killed
	- giltstern was docked at La Sul, unclear how automata got there (was it actually Kingfisher's automata?)
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- gyrfalcon has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for extra money. Don't let it go to war.
- Gyrfalcon cannot be unmasked unless all of the court comes to consensus to remove it
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
- Raven stays silent
Kingfisher Sidequest
- Unmask Macaw. She believes he's corrupt
- interview him: Macaw's governmental duties, political opinions
- try to tail him
	- lead to the saltwood groves
- spy on his office
- go investigate land use
- Gandras Dol might take the PCs help to stop vandalism
Vulture Sidequest?
- Raven has dirt on him, if they can get her support

- encounter against some of Raven's agents. Or Zora somehow tries to fuck them over, put them on the wrong trail? lead to an ambush
- Raven thinks there's something sus abt the kites - sidequest?
Danger in the Reservoirs
- gyrfalcon was investigating this - had questions around reduced security at cistern entrances, their soldiers were called back without their order
- Owl uses guardians to kill/take out all the clerics responsible for purification
	- disable the cisterns so they need to import water from Kevara or import felichian priests from Kevara
- Systematically taking out each reservoir to find Nexida
- cisterns are connected to Piranes' old workshop
The Artificer's workshop
- Owl/Gilead believes that Tensorat's treasure (Nexida) is hidden here - but really he teleported it all away 90 years ago (using Coriolis wish)
- Tensorat was known to be active in Avizallo until 90 yrs ago - is believed that he disappeared into the caverns 
- do a dungeon crawl thru the caverns to reach the vacated lab
	- proper traps/environmental challenge where we roll initiative 
- what is this location? show that it is long gone
	- An empty cavern, the calling sign of the Queen of Thieves (stating that she has found the answer and is betraying them?)
- plant clues
	- the code - "None will find it except in the shadow of the wind"
	- presence of air djinni/teleportation
The Kite Fighters
- ==Owl is using the kites to signal stealth attacks on the reservoirs?
	- using to broadcast arcane signals to control the automata
		- would need to get the eledeia automata near the riot loc
- Merriwink challenges Toby to steal the Valespinner for her
	- also to get back at her "evil" twin, Mettlewise
- Mettlewise won Valespinner when she exposed Coriolis' gambling fraud? 3yrs ago
	- maybe not, would be confusing to have him appear at two time points
- Valespinner - a 100+ yr old kite, engineered by Tensorat. The undisputed champion
	- the spine / inner layering of the kite has some clue
- do research on the sport
- Kite supplies shop run by a dwarf, daughter of stonecutters (aliya stonecutter? kingfisher's protege?)
- kite fighting minigame, stats for each type of kite
	- kite stats: strength, speed, maneuverability
	- initiative is +speed, positioning is +maneuverability
	- other moves? give some kites custom moves?
	- gamble how high you fly it before the string snaps
	- attack: attacker makes speed check against defender's strength save. on a fail, attacker makes strength save to avoid being cut themselves.
Ramping conflict at the docks 
- Kevarans try to harvest saltwood by force? what's stopping them
- Macaw's corruption


show the poverty/lack of autonomy in Avizallo (economics section)

run exploration as a pointcrawl
do favors/sidequests for ppl to get their help
clockwork's involvement? trying to extradite kallista?
coriolis presence?
Potential encounters:

- precipice of a narrow column where ppl could get knocked off
- within the cisterns, water is rising with the tide
- against the assassin
- the boss battle

# Background

## The Conspiracy

Sahuaguin zombie attacks 
- Magical creatures can become undead with some regularity around the Fray - arcane gradient differential causes higher magic concentration just outside the Fray, undead can rise
	- travel quest - show a monster they kill becoming undead
- Owl arranging attacks to distract from reservoir attack, sow conflict - creating and commanding undead sahuagin
Corrupted Guardians
- Took control of Guardians so they won't defend against sahuagin, attack reservoir while ppl distracted
	- has managed to control guardians bc they are undead
	- converted Guardians have a spell seal inside one of the eye cavities
	- have to show guardians doing their job first
- can maybe use Guardians to frame ppl - have them hang around Kingfisher?
- Owl was testing her control over guardians some years ago - led to the fray wraith attack that killed Bluemoon's dad

## The Murder
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding out she's a false priest, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- ==Gyrfalcon became suspicious bc:
		- guard schedule was shifted around in reservoirs so that there were gaps - gyrfalcon was able to fix
		- number of guardians decreased, response time slowed
		- found mentions of the Queen of Thieves?
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence between Orin + Gandras
		- Macaw accidentally left one of Orin's letters at the Rookery? Or the temple?
		- Find letter from Gandras in Orin's mailbox, or Owl produces Orin's letter to put PCs on Macaw's trail
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
- somehow incite the riot
	- automata at the riot were actually Kingfisher's - Owl has some way to control the automata? related to the kites, getting automata to raid the reservoirs?
- faked lividity by beating up the body, then plant the body at the site of riot
	- Assassin casted Lightning Arrow to get electrocution burns
# NPCs

- Alibi: working late in the office (lie), can't say he was actually overseeing at the riots
- Gandras saw Kingfisher at the riot, but Macaw can't say
