# Background

how the murder happened, the assassin's location
- Owl killed Gyrfalcon bc they got too close to finding out she's a false priest, and finding out abt her search for Nexida
	- Killing Gyrfalcon was also convenient to spark a war, which would destroy Avizallo
	- ==how did gyrfalcon find this out??
- Found out gyrfalcon's true identity
	- owl kept all the exam scrolls, including the one for gyrfalcon - was able to match up handwriting with correspondence that gyrfalcon's civilian identity wrote
	- correspondence related to the motive for murder (nexida)
	- wrote to plead for sibling, who was suspiciously arrested while kite fighting?
- Assassin sniped gyrfalcon while they were off service in their apt
	- newly replaced window
- somehow incite the riot
- faked lividity by beating up the body, then plant the body at the site of riot
- assassin
	- play them as a [sharpshooter ranger](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1bm3srp/comment/kw9p4mr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)? or with magic missile?
The Councillors
- owl: the mastermind
	- if owl asks the PCs to help investigate, why?
	- actually serving gilead, expose backstory?
- raven: parallel investigating
- macaw: unknowing accomplice (how), corrupt, soft/optimistic on kevara
- vulture: red tape, potential red herring?
- kingfisher: trying to insert her own choice as gyrfalcon's successor? trying to route macaw
