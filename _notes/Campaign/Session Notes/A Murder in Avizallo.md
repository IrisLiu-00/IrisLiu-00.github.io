## Day 1
#### Arrival in the Isle
- Scene setting
	- High white vanishing fog of the fray. It clears, and you get a glimpse of a reflection - sunlight on black glass, refracted blue and violet in the morning light. Five pillars rise from the ocean, wreathed by white mist at their base. Small black dots of birds spiralling around the tips.
	- A triangular, nearly translucent white shape soars down close - the skull of a bird set at its tip.
	- The top of each pillar is crowned with lush greenery, vines and trees. Set amidst them like jewels are multicolored houses. Birds of every sort (gulls, parrots) wheel and deal in the air, raucous squawking.
	- Draw closer - you see the famed saltwood trees, which look nothing much like trees. White fingers claw their way up the base of each pillar, stark contrast with the black translucence. Built amongst the vertically growing shoots are docks, their wood coated a darker color with waterproofing. Ships large and small pull in gingerly between the gnarled, bone-white roots of the trees. All of the ship have the characteristic white hulls of saltwood hewn, deepwater bound vessels. 
	- People at work in the docks, unloading cargo holds to these elevators that travel on rails up the length of the columns.
- Location: La Sul. Bargewrights, ships, Giltstern.
- Avizallans blocking Felichian missionaries from entering - maybe Kingfisher lets them come in?
- introduce a few major players of the council
- Owl greets them, takes them to the saltwood docks?
- establish Gyrfalcon's animosity, tensions between saltwood workers + KA mercenaries
- spontaneous zombie attack, guardians swoop in
- opportunity to go to Kareem's, Bargewrights, explore city. show the kite fights. 
#### Riot and Murder
- PCs may or may not be at the saltwood docks - either way Gyrfalcon is on the other side
- Riot at the saltwood docks - saltwood workers against Gandras Dol's not increasing wages, Giltstern (seemingly) intervened with automata, a number of saltwood growers killed
	- giltstern was docked at La Sul, unclear how automata got there (was it actually Kingfisher's automata?)
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- gyrfalcon has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for extra money. Don't let it go to war. Make the saltwood deal go thru. 
- Gyrfalcon cannot be unmasked unless all of the court comes to consensus to remove it
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
- Raven stays silent
- Signing of saltwood deal is halted
- might find out it was not giltstern automata thru careful investigation

- Kevarans try to harvest saltwood by force? what's stopping them

- Gandras keeps the diff saltwood groves separate, in competition - so no one realizes his bad accounting
Raven starts tailing the PCs out of suspicion
- ==what do?==
- encounter against some of Raven's agents. Or Zora somehow tries to fuck them over, put them on the wrong trail? lead to an ambush
- Raven thinks there's something sus abt the kites - sidequest?
- zora should have some other side mystery she's investigating  that ties to main thing
- leads: kites
Danger in the Reservoirs
- gyrfalcon was investigating this - had questions around reduced security at cistern entrances, their soldiers were called back without their order
The Artificer's workshop
- Owl/Gilead believes that Tensorat's treasure (Nexida) is hidden here - but really he teleported it all away 90 years ago (using Coriolis wish)
- Tensorat was known to be active in Avizallo until 90 yrs ago - is believed that he disappeared into the caverns 
- do a dungeon crawl thru the caverns to reach the vacated lab
	- proper traps/environmental challenge where we roll initiative 
- what is this location? show that it is long gone
	- An empty cavern, the calling sign of the Queen of Thieves (stating that she has found the answer and is betraying them?)
- plant clues
	- the code - "None will find it except in the shadow of the wind"
	- presence of air djinni/teleportation

	- the spine / inner layering of the kite has some clue
	- has some relation to coriolis?
- do research on the sport
- Kite supplies shop run by a dwarf, daughter of stonecutters (aliya stonecutter? kingfisher's protege?)
- kite fighting minigame, stats for each type of kite

	- initiative is +speed, positioning is +maneuverability
	- other moves? give some kites custom moves?
	- gamble how high you fly it before the string snaps
	- attack: attacker makes speed check against defender's strength save. on a fail, attacker makes strength save to avoid being cut themselves.


show the poverty/lack of autonomy in Avizallo (economics section)

run exploration as a pointcrawl
do favors/sidequests for ppl to get their help (should be resolvable in half a session)
each quest should give clear leads on what to do next, don't just let things happen to the pcs

Other story beats
- assassin starts hunting them, once they get to high enough prominence
- clockwork's involvement? trying to extradite kallista?
- once they figure out the killer, how do they bring down justice? they don't exactly have authority 
Potential encounters:
- rope bridge battle where the bridge is in danger of getting cut
- precipice of a narrow column where ppl could get knocked off
- within the cisterns, water is rising with the tide
- against the assassin
- the boss battle
- combat encounter to get into hidden cove - automata and some monster eledeia controls?
