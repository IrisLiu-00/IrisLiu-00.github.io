		- stats: Jarram
	- Solas + Iolas: human twin deck wizards. Responsible for casting modified Air Bubble spells.
		- stats: Deck Mage (under Harek)
		- Casting a large size air bubble across the whole leviathan takes concentration; they work in 6 hour shifts.

	- Making a stop at Avizallo to take on water, before heading north in search of Azolar Avila's treasure
- Conviviant: Giltstern supply ship taking Isaiah Giltstern to Avizallo for negotiations
	- Oscar: gruff quartermaster
	- Sylvie: head of felichian missionaries
	- Pay your way (500gp), or find some other way

	- Berbert: big bloodhound. Became intelligent + got opposable thumbs thru a Medallion of Wit (stolen from Josephine)
	- Happy to take passengers. Will get attacked by Atlas almost immediately
#### The Journey
- Before leaving
	- Where is the stripper pole installed?
	- Servant (mild mannered eastener) finds the party before leaving and gives them a dossier on Avizallo. Warn them not to let Giltstern know that they're there to protect the deal. 
	- Merriwink calls to give Toby his second task: steal the Valespinner for her, from her "evil" twin Mettlewise
- Scene setting: the departure
	- Josephine calls Iolas - no, Solas to be first watch on the air bubble spell. Steps up to the forehead of the leviathan and rests a hand on its giant horn. A spray of mist ejected from its blowhole - water rains down over the Kevara docks, kids shriek and wave in delight. Solas waves their hands over a giant sigil tattooed on the sea monster's spine, and the saltwater spray hanging in the air collects to form an iridescent membrane around you all. A cheer rises from the pirates as the monster beats its flukes and sinks. 
	- Very low light - a few dark blue rays filter down. Bioluminescent patterns on Atlas' skin light up. Pirates sit down in hammocks strung along the sides, a few climb up long spines for first watch. 
	- Few hours into the ocean, the water above loses all transparency - the milk white of the Fray.
- What do the PCs do for the 3 week journey?
	- Food is unremarkable - hard tack soaked in soup. Iolas amuses the crew by spearing fish with magic missiles
	- Josephine knows the court of birds?
	- stuff abt coriolis?
- Water gets shallower, Atlas has to breach. Lots of tiny black glass isles, choked with seagrass.
- Josephine sends crew onto the atolls to hunt for giant rockfish, which come to lay their eggs. but watch out for sahuagin!
	- sahuagin can dive under water if they have extra movement
- Kevaran navy ships patrolling around Avizallo, naval protection as part of the deal. Hostile to most. 
	- details
## Day 1
#### Arrival in the Isle
La Sul
- Scene setting
	- High white vanishing fog of the fray. It clears, and you get a glimpse of a reflection - sunlight on black glass, refracted blue and violet in the morning light. Five pillars rise from the ocean, wreathed by white mist at their base. Small black dots of birds spiralling around the tips.
	- The top of each pillar is crowned with lush greenery, vines and trees. Set amidst them like jewels are multicolored houses. Birds of every sort (gulls, parrots) wheel and deal in the air, raucous squawking.
	- Draw closer - you see the famed saltwood trees, which look nothing much like trees. White fingers claw their way up the base of each pillar, stark contrast with the black translucence. Built amongst the vertically growing shoots are docks, their wood coated a darker color with waterproofing. Ships large and small pull in gingerly between the gnarled, bone-white roots of the trees. All of the ship have the characteristic white hulls of saltwood hewn, deepwater bound vessels. 
	- People at work in the docks, unloading cargo holds to these elevators that travel on rails up the length of the columns. Food and textiles from trading ships into the isle
- Location: La Sul. Bargewrights, ships, Giltstern.
- Josephine has trouble getting water - an official directing ppl to caskets being brought in from the other isles. Fountains r down. 
- Owl chivvying away some Felichian missionaries. Approaches PCs
	- Sporadic fray wraith attacks recently, some saltwood growers injured/killed. Avizallo's own military power isn't great, doesn't fully trust Giltstern either
	- mentioned problems to Vasilev, who said he would send ppl over
	- can show the PCs over to the groves
La Varza, the saltwood groves
- White barked trees, reaching like skeletal fingers above the water. Very few leaves. Lots of roots spider around each other and cling to crevices in the glass. Wooden docks crisscross between the roots. 
- Druids lined up on one of the docks, some of them holding signs: "Kevaran leeches off our backs", "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work", "Gandras Dol, Giltern's puppet"
- Few other citizens standing back and watching (incl Sabra)
- At the front of the line, Gyrfalcon and Gandras. Gandras has a number of automata behind him. 
	- Gandras Dol: tall, brown skinned man. Dressed in a well tailored sleeveless coat, well tailored arms bared. Half laughing, trying to be polite. 
	- Gyrfalcon: You cannot bring those here, Mister Dol. As a civilian you have no right to use armed enforcement against other citizens. 
	- Dol: Come now, shouldn't a man have a right to see to the security of his own private lands? I don't like to do it, but until the situation is resolved, I need some way to prevent damages to my property. Giltstern enterprises has supplied me with a solution. 
	- Gyrfalcon: I will remind you that the saltwood groves are not your land, they have only been leased to you by the court of birds. I will be bringing this to the court, and then we'll see how much longer you can bring this Kevaran scum onto our docks. 
- Giltstern standing on a higher terrace, turns away
- Fray wraiths attack. Gandras will order automata to help fight. 
	- Fray wraiths come in from sea and engage automata, druids, gyrfalcon. As they're distracted another group comes in from the side, going for the civilians
	- they leave dead bodies when killed - unusual for true wraiths
- Opportunity to explore city:
	- La Sul reservoir is non functional
	- Kareem's, Bargewrights. show the kite fights.
	- people: owl, macaw, raven/zora (spying), giltstern
	- have them figure out where they're staying for the night
- Saved Sabra's life, they are now staying at the Dol mansion
- Everyone bought a kite, Sabra and Toby are going to practice
- Went to Bargewrights. 2 Giltstern sailors, starting to talk to Titus. 
	- Titus has a heavy ring on his pinky. Wife Ella comes demanding child support
how to demonstrate automata remote control. show them coming back to roost as they leave?
meet up with owl

## Day 2
#### Riot and Murder
- At evening, Giltstern issued remote order to recall automata - he needs extras to unload a shipment in time
- PCs may or may not be at the saltwood docks - either way Gyrfalcon is on a dock further away
- Macaw got there first, then reappeared later as Gandras. Told Bluemoon he will bring a footman for safety but didn't (in order to sneak away as Macaw)
- Riot events (if you ask anyone it's unclear what happened)
	- Gandras/Giltstern ordered automata to stand watch - against wraiths, or potential damage from strikers
	- Some say the riot started bc strikers threw rocks, or bc a wraith was spotted, or the automata just started firing into the crowd
	- Number of workers were killed
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- Tight mask, headwrap slightly loose. Clothing rumpled.  Boot laces are slightly loose (assassin put them on). 
	- Pockets: bit of money
	- Body has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for 500 extra gold. Don't let it go to war. Make the saltwood deal go thru. 
	- Insight check: a little edge of ruthless desperation. Pissed if they weren't at the docks.
- Titus, some other druids taken for questioning. Released pretty quickly.
	- (off screen) Ella complains he won't be able to pay child support. Owl breaks them up, steals the ring.
#### The Council Meeting
- early morning, 6am. a cloud of starlings, small green parrots squawk. cargo elevators groan to life, dockworkers hauling in the lifeblood of the isles. 
	- up and down winding paths in the natural, uneven surface of the black glass. across a swaying rope bridge a few hundred feet long to La Centra. 
- rookery: describe
	- sparse crowd milling in front of the rookery: hawk masked guards, sparrow masked functionaries coming to work. A growing throng of commoners, murmurs of unrest
	- Giltstern is here. broad shouldered, mane of gold hair
- meeting in the hall. bannister divides viewing area from the court, guards lined up. court of birds on a circle of six chairs, one empty. Gyrfalcon's shrouded body
	- Vulture, dark cloaked; Owl, straightening prayer beads; Kingfisher, poised; Raven, silent; Macaw, rushing in late
- Q/A session, anyone can shout questions. A guard rings a bell to cast silence on the ppl.
- Vulture: call into session. Gyrfalcon was killed in an altercation at La Varza docks early this morning. Kevaran automata were involved
- Kingfisher: western saltwood druids have flat out refused to harvest the trees until justice is done. War hawk factions are calling for blood. Saltwood deal is under threat
- Owl: need to unmask Gyrfalcon - first step to understanding what happened
	- mask cannot be removed unless all the others come to consensus
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs, Giltstern) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Giltstern: willing to fully cooperate. He called his automata back to La Sul last night.
- Raven/Owl can mention that Gandras barely stayed to help out at the riot scene
- Vulture: need to start process for another civil service exam
- Opinions
	- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
	- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
	- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
	- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
	- Raven stays silent
- What's next (recs from Owl)
	- scene of the crime (riot)
	- talk to ppl who know what's up w the city (Myla, Kareem)
	- giltstern
- investigated riot site, now its 12pm
	- found broken crate w Orin's body
	- talk to seagull - they know the body was transported there in a crate, and the other automata left via crate
	- asked a bunch of kevarans abt Kingswill, ersatz told them some things

### Following the Automata
- Crew found automata track (skid mark) at top of la varza elevator, going towards La Centra
- Mention kites wheeling overhead
- a lot of ppl pushing crates work for Eledeia. No one has seen automata delivering crates topside
- maybe they should have been sent straight to l'esta. just say you got the map wrong
### Toby's Date
- Toby rushed back late to his date with Sabra, seems to have patched things up. they're going to Kareem's Beans
- Titus and goons comes up for a break, sees Toby with Sabra. Might find out the PCs are staying with Gandras.
	- Titus tries to threaten Sabra - theres not much of a real conflict tho
- Potential to notice Zora spying

- crossing la centra for searching for the automata crates - we should have a battle/some encounter
	- Toby and Sabra separately at Kareem's - do a fight and put her in danger? another wraith attack?
		- consequences for toby leaving the group, make him choose - difficult encounter, need his help if they get captured
	- just say that its not possible to follow them thru the city - unless they have magic/other justification
	- or they succeed and end up at eledeia? find the cove, do battle
		- glyph of warding? take the stairs in some pattern, or the automata activate
		- need battlemap, enemy stats already exist - front wave of automata, 1-2 in back responsible for pulling a sahuagin out every turn. smash the skull on the ground
		- only a few overridden automata responsible for hiding the cove, try to keep PCs out
		- they need to understand politics more, the ban on building ships
		- they can know it's owned by eledeia, but can't meet her. 
	- they fail - almost make it to the cove but are captured by automata watch? zora ambush?
	- Raven or Zora ambushes (either for the ring or the murder)
		- block off bridge, force to take elevator
### Gandras' Secrets
- Sabra still has a morning date with Toby, and she doesn't know what the PCs r here for
- Mushika is here?
- Chance to faceoff w Gandras in the end
- reward if success: treasure, info abt gandras' corruption, 
	- long term info? kingfisher problem.  reward that ties into mainline
- if espionage fails
	- chase scene ([complications](https://5e.tools/tables.html#urban%20chase%20complications_dmg), roll each round for how many guard appear)
	- pretty limited places to hide from the law, unless they leave the isle
	- captured - owl helps them if they go after kingfisher/raven? (look for missing exam scrolls), kingfisher makes a deal to expose Macaw (for a greater reward?)

## Upcoming

Break into rookery
- Get disguises from the guards, an access key
Kingfisher Sidequest
- Unmask Macaw. She believes he's corrupt, wants to usurp him to insert her own choice
	- Macaw/Gandras links: letters in rookery office, tax breaks, 
- Gandras Dol might take the PCs help to stop vandalism
- interview him: Macaw's governmental duties, political opinions
- try to tail him (saltwood groves, rookery), go to home or rookery office
- if they majorly damage Gandras his faction/Giltstern can come after them
- if Kingfisher gets the info: she doesn't need a new opening bc one already exists. She wants Macaw in her pocket for choosing Myla. 
- if it's exposed to the world: Gandras is ousted. Maybe loses his saltwood to Eledeia/Court, workers will definitely want him gone. Kingfisher may vouch for him to preserve appearances. Giltstern will ditch him, pivot to Kingfisher. 
Vulture Sidequest?
- Raven has dirt on him, if they can get her support
- Vulture would like to weaken Kingfisher - too chummy with the Kevarans
- coriolis? leads?
Unmasking Gyrfalcon
- Expose identity and home address
- battle at Orin's house should be pretty major (an ambush? multiple factions collide). give up a big repository of clues
- magic missile / sniper wound within Orin's mouth
- electrocution burns on body don't entirely match automata attacks (was a spell instead)
- leads: reservoirs (from house), 
Raven starts tailing the PCs out of suspicion
- encounter against some of Raven's agents. Or Zora somehow tries to fuck them over, put them on the wrong trail? lead to an ambush
- Zora plants a tracker on one of the PCs
- Zora investigating a mystery for Titus: he purchased a nice ring off of Kareem a few years back and it's missing
	- Bronze ring of braided metal - 4 stranded braid pattern
	- Titus noticed it missing when they checked him out of questioning at the Rookery
	- Titus thinks his ex wife Ella took it off him to pawn for child support
	- Zora thinks the new adventurers in town might have stolen it, since adventurers are treasure hungry
	- Zora knows the ring is magic from Kareem, a little worried
- leads: kites
	- either Raven trusts them and tells them Merriwink is up to something weird, or Zora says she's investigating sth for Myla?
Danger in the Reservoirs
- gyrfalcon was investigating this - had questions around reduced security at cistern entrances, their soldiers were called back without their order
- tensorat helped engineer a lot of the reservoirs to ...?
The Artificer's workshop
- Tensorat was known to be active in Avizallo until 90 yrs ago - is believed that he disappeared into the caverns 
- do a dungeon crawl thru the caverns to reach the vacated lab
	- proper traps/environmental challenge where we roll initiative 
- plant clues
	- the code - "None will find it except in the shadow of the wind"
	- presence of air djinni/teleportation
- more clues leading to Owl
- [lab dungeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/aqm7xo/dungeon_tinkerfitz_labs/)
The Kite Fighters
- there will be a tournament in a few days time, where Valespinner will by flying
- wining valespinner also gives an advantage to tensorat's labs? passphrases?
Get access to Giltstern's data - infiltrate or fight


each quest should give clear leads on what to do next, don't just let things happen to the pcs

Ratcheting the tension
- PCs are staying w Gandras, so these will be against them: saltwood workers, Gyrfalcon, Kingfisher, Myla
	- Kingfisher might still use them if she determines they don't actually care abt Gandras
- more fray attacks, possibly an actual fray tide
- more reservoirs getting taken out, whenever there's the chance
- more conflict at the docks, with the saltwood growers
- assassin starts hunting them, once they get to high enough prominence
- anyone they offend will come after them
- war - attack on conviviant, giltstern stops imports + calls in navy, kevaran blockade, 
	- show threat of war - ppl protesting/throwing stuff at the conviviant. subset of the military prepping themselves. Vulture campaigning. Giltstern threatens retaliation if the deal doesn't go thru
Potential encounters:
- ambush from raven (in the elevator?)
- get gandras' accounting - infiltrate the vaults
- against the feather scouts/mettlewise
- against the assassin - if they find the cove, morgana saire
- combat encounter to get into hidden cove - automata and fray wraiths
	- stop the automata from pulling out and activating wraiths
- the boss battle - happen at the precipice of war
- urban chase, staircases
- rope bridge battle where the bridge is in danger of getting cut
	- assassin firing arrows to cut the rope? other enemies coming from both sides?
- precipice of a narrow column where ppl could get knocked off
- inside a halted elevator (NSBU)
- within the cisterns, water is rising with the tide





# Treasure
- Loot dropped by owl
	- Ring of mind shielding: a bronzework ring made of intricate woven wires, small green stones set at intervals. The weaving actually makes up magic runes, recognized by Gyrfalcon.
- Loot dropped by assassin
	- crossbow
- gifts from npcs
- [Portable Hole](https://5e.tools/items.html#portable%20hole_dmg): A circular sheet of fine black cloth, 6ft in diameter. Use an action to unfold it against a solid surface, whereupon it creates an extradimensional hole 10ft deep. You can use an action to fold up the hole. Any creatures or objects remain inside the extradimensional space. The folded cloth weighs next to nothing. 

# Scratchpad

- Write down notes as things progress during the game.
