# Scenes

## Mission Assignment
- Scene setting
	- Vasilev drinks from a flask
- PCs need to go to Avizallo to make sure the saltwood deal is successful, to protect Giltstern (and maybe spy on him)
	- Giltstern has arrived in Avizallo and tensions are running high - Owl thinks there needs to be another impartial Kevaran party to keep Giltstern in check.
	- Prices of saltwood are set, but they're hammering out a deal for how much wood to sell to Kevara
	- Vasilev wants to maintain political stability, and a lot of his wealth from his estates depends on trade running smoothly
- Vasilev gives them badges as proof of authority
- Beware of the Court of Birds - never trust a man who won't tell you his true name
- what does the saltwood deal do for vasilev? she's positioned against giltstern in the power struggle
	- ppl shipping saltwood in stuck outside the city, can't vote (bring the fray nets up)
	- make them pay a lot for saltwood, then sabotage the goods
## Journey to Avizallo
- a few choices for how to get there - leviathan, giltstern supply ship (with felichian missionaries)
- don't just do a fight, have some exploration/survival/social tension/mystery
- encounter kevaran navy ships patrolling around avizallo, and undead attack
	- dramatic tension?
- show a monster they kill becoming undead - ambient arcane turmoil
## Day 1
Arrival in the Isle
- establish Gyrfalcon's animosity, tensions between saltwood workers + KA mercenaries
- Avizallans blocking Felichian missionaries from entering - maybe Kingfisher lets them come in?
- introduce a few major players of the council
Riot and Murder
- Riot at the saltwood docks - saltwood workers against Gandras Dol's not increasing wages, Giltstern intervened with automata, a number of saltwood growers killed
	- giltstern was docked at La Sul, unclear how automata got there (was it actually Kingfisher's automata?)
- Gyrfalcon gets killed in the chaos
	- gyrfalcon has electrocution, blunt force, lacerations
	- Body is interred in the Rookery, Owl/another cleric has cast Gentle Repose so it won't decay
- Vasilev gives new goal: figure out circumstances of Gyrfalcon's murder for extra money. Don't let it go to war. Make the saltwood deal go thru. 
- Gyrfalcon cannot be unmasked unless all of the court comes to consensus to remove it
	- Kingfisher refuses to unmask while outsiders (PCs) are involved
	- Vulture won't unmask until the Court forms a "plan of succession" - basically they need to agree to approve a candidate Vulture likes
- Kingfisher blames Kevara, demands reparations from Giltstern
- Vulture blames Kevara, takes it as more evidence that Avizallo should cut off connections
- Owl subtly stokes the flames - the hearts of Avizallans know what is needed
- Macaw pleads for peace, more investigation needed, suggests an Avizallan killed them in the confusion
- Raven stays silent
- Signing of saltwood deal is halted
Kingfisher Sidequest
- Unmask Macaw. She believes he's corrupt
- interview him: Macaw's governmental duties, political opinions
- try to tail him
	- lead to the saltwood groves
- spy on his office
- go investigate land use
- Gandras Dol might take the PCs help to stop vandalism
Vulture Sidequest?
- Raven has dirt on him, if they can get her support
- Vulture would like to weaken Kingfisher - too chummy with the Kevarans
- coriolis?
Unmasking Gyrfalcon
- Expose identity and home address
- magic missile / sniper wound within Orin's mouth
Ramping tension at the docks / something related to V's directive?
- Monsters attack - growers refuse to defend
- Fray tide that Guardians don't defend against
- Saltwood growers get even more incited, start vandalizing Dol/Giltstern property
- Kevarans try to harvest saltwood by force? what's stopping them
- Gandras' corruption - he has overpromised saltwood stock and failed to deliver
- Gandras keeps the diff saltwood groves separate, in competition - so no one realizes his bad accounting
Raven starts tailing the PCs out of suspicion
- ==what do?==
- encounter against some of Raven's agents. Or Zora somehow tries to fuck them over, put them on the wrong trail? lead to an ambush
- Raven thinks there's something sus abt the kites - sidequest?
- zora should have some other side mystery she's investigating  that ties to main thing
Danger in the Reservoirs
- gyrfalcon was investigating this - had questions around reduced security at cistern entrances, their soldiers were called back without their order
The Artificer's workshop
- Owl/Gilead believes that Tensorat's treasure (Nexida) is hidden here - but really he teleported it all away 90 years ago (using Coriolis wish)
- Tensorat was known to be active in Avizallo until 90 yrs ago - is believed that he disappeared into the caverns 
- do a dungeon crawl thru the caverns to reach the vacated lab
	- proper traps/environmental challenge where we roll initiative 
- what is this location? show that it is long gone
	- An empty cavern, the calling sign of the Queen of Thieves (stating that she has found the answer and is betraying them?)
- plant clues
	- the code - "None will find it except in the shadow of the wind"
	- presence of air djinni/teleportation
The Kite Fighters
- Merriwink challenges Toby to steal the Valespinner for her
	- also to get back at her "evil" twin, Mettlewise
- Mettlewise: star disciple in Owl's church. prophet, child prodigy. type A, tattletale. 
	- unwitting tool of Morgana
- Valespinner - a 100+ yr old kite, engineered by Tensorat. The undisputed champion
	- the spine / inner layering of the kite has some clue
	- has some relation to coriolis?
- do research on the sport
- Kite supplies shop run by a dwarf, daughter of stonecutters (aliya stonecutter? kingfisher's protege?)
- kite fighting minigame, stats for each type of kite
	- kite stats: strength, speed, maneuverability
	- initiative is +speed, positioning is +maneuverability
	- other moves? give some kites custom moves?
	- gamble how high you fly it before the string snaps
	- attack: attacker makes speed check against defender's strength save. on a fail, attacker makes strength save to avoid being cut themselves.


show the poverty/lack of autonomy in Avizallo (economics section)

run exploration as a pointcrawl
do favors/sidequests for ppl to get their help (should be resolvable in half a session)

Other story beats
- assassin starts hunting them, once they get to high enough prominence
- clockwork's involvement? trying to extradite kallista?
- once they figure out the killer, how do they bring down justice? they don't exactly have authority 
Potential encounters:
- rope bridge battle where the bridge is in danger of getting cut
- precipice of a narrow column where ppl could get knocked off
- within the cisterns, water is rising with the tide
- against the assassin
- the boss battle
- combat encounter to get into hidden cove - automata and some monster eledeia controls?
