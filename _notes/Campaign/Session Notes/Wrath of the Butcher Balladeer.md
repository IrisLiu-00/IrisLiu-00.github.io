# Random 

Goals
- a longer adventure, multiple stages
- more player agency
- ending should introduce the big bad (council), lead to Mirwood or Avizallo (player choice?)

Big Picture
- start planting the artificer's code (symbols for letters, RTL text)
- relate to quest for engine piece, history of city
- give a chance to learn about Vasilev's backstory
- plant seeds for Vasilev's election gambit

- they're trying to manipulate positioning for the Avizallo diplomacy trip
	- V is trying to put bridgers on the party to go to Avizallo (as mercs?)
	- V is trying to manipulate Ornsgrym out of the diplomat's party - but Giltstern steps in and sends luca as a proxy instead? or Giltstern/Feldspar goes?
	- idk the point of this if it doesn't directly affect players or give them agency
- what do all the factions think: V, lords, Patrician, merchers, bridgers, merrow, avizallo
	- V - focused on getting grave goods for the election
	- lords move to outlaw drugs, but ppl who have used in the past are still possessed
	- rival lord offers a job to investigate V - thinks she is behind the assassinations. Then assassination attempt on V
	- merchers
	- bridgers try to get in on the drug trade, don't care much about assassinations
	- avizallo
	- 

More assassination attempts - requires PCs to be in public situations
- it shouldn't be immediately clear that the assassins are all smokers
- PCs are called on as security detail? for liasons with elves or avizallo? guard a saltwood shipment?
- attempt on Patrician's life - assailant dies
- nobles hire automata - potential encounter where automata go out of control or sth
- attempt on Vasilev - someone infiltrates her house. why would the PCs be in her house at night
- if they still don't care, attempt to kill the PCs

Info the PCs need to find the dungeon
- assassination attempts are connected to the smoke
- smoke is supplied by Ornsgrym, who gets it from the archaeological society?
- the archaeological society is a front for the cult
- the archaeologists are planning a dig under the school / the cult is based there

# Scenes

## Downtime
Shopping - PCs have abt 1800gp
- Mik's Marketplace -  All items are unique unless otherwise specified. 
	- Potion of Healing: 50gp, 2 in stock. 
	- All or Nothing Coin: 80gp. This duplicitous coin can spell fortune or ruin for its owner. When making an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can flip a coin in place of rolling a d20. Heads is treated as a 20, while tails is treated as a 1. The coin cannot be used again until the next dawn.
	- Mockingbird Gum: 140gp. These green and blue speckled minty sticks of chewing gum come in a pack of 5 sticks. As an action, you can eat one stick of gum and gain the ability to imitate another creatureâ€™s voice for 1 hour. A creature that hears you can tell that the voice is an imitation by making a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check.
	- Immovable Rod: 230gp. This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
	- Band of Projected Thought: 250gp. While wearing this headband, you can telepathically communicate with any creature that speaks at least one language within 30 feet.
- Ass Play Work Orders
- Other items
	- armor, poisons?
Ask everyone what they're doing in downtime
- Fray tide looms over the city for the next few weeks, an ever present cloud bank at the city's eastern port. Sailors mutter bad omens, mages curse lapsing spells, and the common folk stay inside. Despite the city's protections that have stood against the Fray for millennia, no resident of the Leuchroic coast has ever made it long without learning a healthy fear of the sea. 
- Headlines on the next issue of the Gisney Times
	- events of last adventure. tie into Vasilev's plans if you have them
Scene with bluemoon learning artificing
- Luca's workshop: gleaming chrome and brass, dials, puffs of whistling steam. Drawers and bins of parts - gears, wires of different gauges, crystal shards. Slightly disarrayed, except for one workbench kept very neat order, but Luca approaches his own bench.
- Pass thru assembly floor - bustling with machinists assembling rows of automata
	- Suddenly a lot of demand for work - word really got out from that bridge debacle. Any publicity is good publicity
	- Nobles + merchants ordering for private security - would have really preferred a less militaristic approach, but they're working on better safety guards
- Misurium crystal engraving and reading of data
	- silvery, transparent crystals with a liquid sheen
	- old wizards and artificers used them to store research and spells so that laypeople could not read them
	- the great artificer Piranes discovered that multiple misurium crystals lined up in sequence could be used to read and write data, or make decisions based on it
- convo
	- Adventurers don't tend to hang out in big cities, do they? what keeps you all here
	- suspicious of Vasilev
	- insp - it's about being the best
- What gadgets is bluemoon working on?
Scene with Merriwink testing Toby?
- Merriwink's trainee tries to pickpocket Toby
	- Goliath named Jacky just tries to straight up threaten/shake loose toby's money
	- Merriwink comes out to stop him - they've been having a deficit of proper apprentices lately
- Becoming an inductee of the Thieves' Guild (Society of Economic Liberation) requires passing certain trials
	- first one is to steal 200gp worth of gold and contribute it to the Society



## The Show

- Read aloud
	- The curtain rises on a dimmed stage; in the background a painted set of a crumbling castle. With a thrum the violins spring to life, the glint of rosin and wood from the pit. A chorus onstage begins singing in wordless notes. There's a roll of sheet metal to mimic thunder, and an enormous monster winds onto stage - golden scales, leathery wings, spouting illusory flame - a dragon! As the dragon turns to menace the chorus, who break and scatter as the music swells, two new figures run onto stage. A woman holding a staff and dagger, and a man in a helm holding a long lance. 
	- The man shouts - 'tis too late, Arda! We have dallied, and the end is near.' The woman replies - 'You speak false, Kevar! With your lance and my sorcery, we shall see our fates are just.' And the man says, 'Verily. Today, this scourge - this evil - shall dieee~!; They break into song. With a clash of cymbals and the roll of drums, the heroes leap into mock-battle. 
	- You all are sitting comfortably in a very nice private box, viewing this performance of *The Ballad of Kevar and Arda*, presented by the Sirenian Players. To your left is the Duke Vasilev, who brought you all to this performance tonight and secured your seats. He is sipping a glass of wine and idly watching the show - how have you all been finding the performance?
- Slight commotion in nearby box - a number of young, well dressed ppl shuffle around their seats as someone enters their box, looks like a dwarf woman. This dwarf enters, trailing a wreath of smoke that smells like old paper, or maybe like ripe peaches, or maybe like ocean air. That dwarf, you've been told, is a graverobber. The case she's holding is what you are here for. 
- That dwarf has information you are seeking; how do you get to her?
- Vasilev brought them here to find an in with the graverobbers
	- Vasilev wants souls to spoof votes in upcoming election
	- 800gp for the job
- The play has stuff abt divine intervention etc

### Filroy and Friends
- 2 guards outside the box, wearing orange + blue of house Filroy. Will prevent strangers from entering.
- Lordlings will be initially distrustful/supercilious of PCs, do not recognize them and want them to leave. 
- Carolus - wreathed in pearly smoke, holding a long pipe. Whoa, dudes, I think I was like, a really cool mysterious pirate in that one. 
	- Damien - that's nothing, three weeks ago I got one of the imperial conquerors. Nothing like tearing through the countryside with a soulsforge axe, just cutting through swathes of enemies
	- Show the smokers getting ability bonuses
- Carolus Filroy: Duke Filroy's young nephew. Ringleader of the bunch. Self absorbed, superior, superficial. Riding on the power of his uncle. 
	- voice: crunch moon jones. Lots of "like", "dude". Open mouth, back of the mouth, rhotic, californian
	- appearance: flop of light blond hair, unbuttoned doublet, very nice pantaloons
	- stats: noble
	- only cares for others as far as they can entertain or do something for him
	- Lord Filroy has increased his investments in some young upstart inventor, expect he will be very grateful to our generosity
- Damien: nasal, nasty, jealous of others' closeness to Carolus. Family is high up in Isidor enterprises
	- smoking heavily
	- Does not like the show - saw much better last spring
- Lauswa: young orc woman. Bored at having to associate with these Kevarans
	- voice: broad, long vowels. Dentalised THs
	- Daughter of a commanding Langksaran officer in occupied Khamgard
- Torek: old woman, dwarf necromancer. Woman of few words. Gruff. 
	- thick glasses, lots of shawls and beads. Holding a case containing stuff for Elysian Fog
	- "newly excavated, newly ritualized. very good. these prices, you see them nowhere else."
	- Was a practicing necromancer, started working with the historical society - not possessed, but willing to cover for the cultists for the sake of money
	- Doesn't really want to talk abt the graverobbers / the historical society for fear of revealing things
	- Not directly involved in extracting grave goods, just does the postprocessing
	- Most young lords have been purchasing from Ornsgrym. Ornsgrym will be public at the send off of a Kevara diplomat tmr, most likely will also be selling. 
	- Can speak on the nature of elysian fog - origins, how it's made
- Perception check for what's going on V
	- speaking with Ornsgrym? hands him a glass of wine
- Play concludes, a Felichian priest speaks
	- Curtain falls, leader of the company comes on stage. Thanks to the Felichian church for sponsoring this season's performances
	- Felichian priestess - the tale of Kevar and Arda and their conquest of the darkness is as pertinent today as it was five hundred years ago. Just as their paths were guided by Felichias those many millennia ago, so too can we trust the gods to guide our fates today. 
- Assassination attempt
	- if PCs don't notice (Pcpt DC18), Damien gets a surprise round, then roll initiative
	- Damien pulls out a knife to slit Carolus's throat - trying to cut out his vocal cords
	- "enough of this derivative dribble- let's make something interesting"
- If they subdue Damien
	- "for the Composition!"
	- Only talks about the composition or is catatonic. Removing possession leaves them with no memory of events

Pick up here
- Damien fainted, is pinned under the Rod
	- Damien comes to in a bit, confused about what happened. Just felt like the opera singing was really annoying, got pissed. 
	- Carolus: Damien has always had asthma, is prone to fits - will ask attendants to keep a closer eye on him
- Torek: anyone who wants to buy Elysian fog should go thru Ornsgrym, she does not handle sales
- another assassination attempt against V - 2 is coincidence, 3 is a pattern
	- Lauswa is assailant?


### Elysian Fog
- Small ceramic jars, each labelled + filled w ash. Torek takes a very small pinch and packs into the end of a long pipe. Mutters some words over it, snaps her gnarled fingers above the bowl of the pipe, a small spark falls into it. 
- Nacreous, shimmering, thick smoke, taken by a long pipe (like opium pipe)
- Taking a drag fills you with a heady, floaty feeling, and you start to see faces and scenery in the smoke surrounding you. The release of being anyone but yourself. It smokes clean, there's no low after effects wear off. 
	- similar to possession, but not technically true possession because the original soul is not there
- Souls leave an imprint on bodily remains, process via ritual into flammable substance
	- necromantic ritual to select + amplify bits of memory
Mechanics 
- let them make a check to see which benefits each smoke gives
- Seacaptain (80gp) - the great leviathan captain Azolar Avila buried with his first mate and all his deckhands in the ribcage of his leviathan
	- feet planted on the rolling back of a sea monster, hobnailed boots digging into its hide. A burst of cold sea air on your face. Laughing and quaffing ale with your sailors as you break into chests of treasure. Swinging from a rope across the spiny sail. The flash of rapiers dancing across the deck of a burning ship. The cool darkness of ocean depths, looking out of your breathing bubble at shadows of sea life.
	- 1d4 to DEX checks+saves for 1hr
- Warrior (60gp) - an orcish soldier during the Langksaran conquest
	- Looking out across a plain as four tusked war oliphants march. Searing pain as a broadsword slices into your side. Your first glimpse of the monumental statues framing the port of Kevara Arda, your breath caught in your throat. Roars and cheers following the palanquin of your emperor. Flame and triumph as you broach the gates of the Patrician's hill in Kevara. 
	- 1d4 to strength checks for 1hr
- Courtesan (55gp) - some well to do minor noble of the old Duke V's court
	- Silks and satin and human skin. Spiraling lights in a ballroom, the clink of crystal. Laughs and sideways glances and words unsaid. A shadow upon a dais - a human man in a black and silver trimmed robe, closely followed by a drow boy in black. 
	- 1d4 to insight checks for 1hr
- Mage (70gp) - kerrigan the mage? unconfirmed, possibly an apprentice
	- Lightning striking a high, lonely tower. Books with crackling pages written in languages only you can understand. The knowledge that space and mass are but shadows cast upon the mortal world. Rippling the fabric of reality with your hands. 
	- 1d4 to INT checks+saves for 1hr
- Possession: DC10 WIS save against possession, increases by 2 for every usage of the smoke


### The Sirenian Players
- Alara: human woman, playing Arda
- Garthik: half orc man, playing Kevar
- Elind: small, dark, lively halfling woman with short hair. Troupe leader
- potentially can speak about the school?
- do these guys have involvements w the fog? the church? the nobles?

## The Brightides Festival

### About
- The Fray clears! The sky is blue again, musical rattling sound as the statues lower the Fray nets
- Festival for the start of the trading season - early autumn, marks when the trade winds turn
	- Kevara-Arda is an engine that runs on trade, and they mark time by it. 
	- The great shipping boats will soon start making their circuit around the interior of the Leuchroic sea - laden with grains from the fertile Laamveldt, they'll sail east past the gates of Kevara-Arda to the coasts of the inland empire, Langksa. Along the way they'll pick up spices and textiles from the Sutherlands, as the lively clipper ships of the southern poet kings stream their way through the strait. The trading companies will make their way north to the frost-bitten mountains for dwarven craftwork and ores, then down past the misty coast of the Mirwood, until they return at the end of spring, hulls sitting low in the water with exotic goods and gold, to weather out the rainy season until the cycle starts again. 
- Sixpoints plaza in Kings' End - six streets leading to a star shaped plaza
	- streets cleaned - scalecobbles (large, round flagstones) burnished to a bright bronze
	- clustered with people, densely packed stalls, games, performances. Priests weave between, swinging smoking censers to give blessings, nobles processions in palanquins
	- colorful wind socks flapping in the air, decorated like dolphins and whales and leviathans
- Vasilev asks the PCs to get whatever info abt Gyrfalcon they can? maybe not, too unrelated.
- Ornsgrym has been buying and selling the Elysian fog to other nobles, but Stevian has the actual contacts with the manufacturers.
	- Stevian is missing - went to get poison and distribute to assassins.
- Gyrfalcon mistrusts the Kevarans, believes they're making an unfair deal for the saltwood
	- are they actually doing anything relevant tho
	- A diplomat is being sent off to Avizallo to discuss the coming year's saltwood trade - Kevara has not built new ships in nearly a decade
### Bazaar

	- Griddled hotcakes drizzled with honey and cinnamon and clotted cream
	- Small grilled fish on skewers
	- Spiced shredded meat in a skinny flour wrap, dip in yogurt sauce
	- Lacru - sweet-salty milk based drink, hot or cold

	- Lost? why not buy a homing badger! Guaranteed to find their way home (they do, an hour after purchase)
	- Guaranteed dragon bones
- Ersatz selling false Elysian Fog?
	- Saw Stevian - browsed the false fog, then went to the poisoner's stall
- Might meet Ringley and Lyell - Ringley is probably drinking. 
- Stevian is speaking to one of the Patrician's guard? where? feels like this should be more of a reward
	- stevian/ghost won't willingly tell ppl the location of the archaeologists, but the butcher will be prepared that ppl are searching or them
	- On his body - a long narrow pipe, a receipt for an Elysian Fog order, with an address in Arda
- A palanquin in burgundy + brown livery passes - Duke Ornsgrym sitting atop, tossing handfuls of copper coins
- [ ] Toby gets contacted by Merriwink
	- things have changed - he can pass the first trial of initiation if he steals a branch of the felichian sacred flame. Also grab me one of those hotcakes while you're at it.

	- Alara came to Sixpoints early yesterday to set up the stage, was noticed by cultists
		- Met people working for one of the Dukes (Stevian) to organize permits for the stage
		- Told them she met an old friend (was charmed?) working for an Archaeological society - friend was a schoolmate at Bridgewater, convinced her to go back to visit 
	- Performance is a lot of traditional folk songs, skits from the Kevara-Ardan Cycle
	- Perf check to see how much money they get, and if they get noticed by a cultist
### Sixpoints Plaza
- Priests of Felichias giving readings of the signs for the coming trade season
	- Open air area around a wide metal brazier. Two guards around the perimeter, several priests clad in white + gold robes clustered around the fire. 
	- inscribe a question onto soft driftwood, throw in the flame > priest interprets the sparks/colors
	- things to foreshadow 
		- travel to the heart of the whiteness
		- sth abt Toby and his father
	- Father Thrain - shaggy, smiling minotaur priest. Jokester.

	- Ornsgrym is followed by Stevian
	- Filroy has brought private guard of automatas
	- Damien, Carolus in the crowd

	- someone whispers, old Bacrust should just die and let us elect a new patrician already
	- halfway thru the griffon starts screeching and someone chuckles
	- Coughing fit > a guard moves aside to let a attendant bring him some water

	- all the assassins have poisoned knives (single use dosage)
	- Stevian uses cacophony with violin, cultist guard tries to attack Ornsgrym
	- Damien tries to attack Carolus Filroy
	- Filroy screams for automata to do something, stop people from coming
- One of the automata lets loose a stray shot, bursts the locks on Owlbear, Griffon. chaos ensues
	- what does each party do? Beasts attack automata, cultists try to run?
	- fire spreads somehow
- if they don't get enough info, Filroy asks them to investigate Vasilev > do another assassination, let them capture Stevian or whatever

try to come up with a cool centerpiece/ceremony
- about wind, trade, fate, fire
- a ritual to try to direct fate, prevent the fray
- burning of the old, anointing of the new - everyone has to give up something of theirs to burn
- running of the bulls - summon dragons from fire


## Clockwork's Trap
- or merriwink says she has info on the grave robbers?
- Old ironworks - brick building, dusty windows. Wide open floor w vats they used to melt ore
- Steel mesh catwalk stretches above - a hint of movement
	- Merriwink may call out to Toby if hesitant
- Clockwork on the platform at the end of the catwalk, Merriwink tied up behind him
	- ==checking his pocket watch
	- Extort for information about Kallista - where did she come from, who has she talked to
	- Get into a fight - call her here alone and I'll let you go
	- ==what is Toby thinking or feeling as this happens?
	- Rolls up his sleeves, exposing manacled wrists, connected to a chain. One end of the chain goes to his pocket watch in his hand. The other end he draws outwards from his duster, the links clinking as they move. He swings it with a slow, indolent menace, and you see that at that other end is an ornate, curlicued metal point - the sharpened hand of an enormous clock. 
	- Timed explosion can blow out the stairs - it's a fifty foot drop to the bottom
	- anything to prevent him running away?
- Clockwork can backflip out a window once it goes bad for him

## The Kevara-Arda Archaeological Society
- basically a bunch of graverobbers - used to be a ragtag association of ppl trying to steal and sell treasure, recently ballooned due to demand for Elysian fog
- Located Arda side - they can take a ferry to cross

First Floor
- Front + back entrance
	- Front entrance goes to a reception desk to buy an entry ticket (2gp), manned by Quercus
	- Back entrance is for adventurers bringing in loot - goes to a cargo elevator to the second floor
- Quercus: gnome cultist, crotchety old man with round glasses, hair growing out nostrils. Quivery old man voice. 
	- Overbearing, tells ppl not to touch anything. 
	- Flute stored under desk, but originally does not know music

	- Centerpiece - bones of a juvenile war oliphaunt from the Langksaran conquest, ~800 yrs ago
	- Old suit of armor missing a few pieces
	- Pottery shards + such
	- Any organic remains have already been removed - a mummy
- Narrow staircase to the side goes upstairs, cordoned off w a velvet rope. Receptionist will try to stop visitors from passing thru

	- A few older men and women inspecting artifacts under magnifying glasses, flipping thru old texts
	- One half of the room is cleared out, with a large magic circle drawn on the floor. Traces of bone dust. Ritual knife, etc. Where they get the necromancers to process Elysian Fog. 
- Lyell and Ringley working behind one desk - Lyell examining old parchments with a pair of gloves, muttering under his breath. Ringley trying to balance a parchment airplane on his nose. 
	- Here as consultants to make some money - archaeologists want them to find potential dig sites from the age of Kevar and Arda, but that seems really unlikely. Mention Kevar's lance?
	- Saw Alara come here on the day of the festival with Stevian - they said they were going to visit their alma mater later
- Woman's handbag set atop one of the desks (Alara's) - some money, lines for the Ballad of Kevar/Arda, cosmetics

## The Dungeon
### The School
- Bridgewater U: Arda-side university
- Near the border of the Khamgaard occupation
- Yu - changeling prof for performance arts
- evidence of Alara's passage thru
### Background
- Basements of the collapsed ISEC (Instrumental Soundcraft and Elocution Center)
- Built ~80 years ago when the school tried to revitalize its image, rapidly abandoned when a mysterious accident collapsed the whole building
	- The Butcher nearly completed his shriek metal black grunge composition - his first rehearsal brought the building down, killing a lot of students/teachers who were in it
- Basement is still intact and is connected to an unexplored section of the catacombs

Getting into dungeon - sth to make the archaeological society worth
- need to perform a tune to expose the entrance
- knowledge of where the entrance is
- some passphrase to get in
- warding seal on the basements only lets two souls in - the butcher or leanna
	- PCs would have to capture a cultist or subject themselves to possession
### Layout
- 3 levels, 3 areas in each level - 3 mid battles, 1 boss battle? add more as needed
- find the artificer's code - was here hunting for Coriolis ~90 years ago, left a datacrystal. Konrad can help decipher
- Final face off: Leanna + ghost in lair
- reduced threat ghosts as prior monsters in the dungeon - victims of the slasher
- patrol outside - see if players notice
- have cultists run away to alert others (retreat on round 2, alert on round 3)
- bad guys target the light armored ones first
- resting -> chance of a random encounter?
- have the cultists take a captive to rescue?
- secret treasure room behind a riddle
- wraparound mirror room battle - in a dance studio, each ghoul is a diff dance style
	- make each section of the dungeon abt a diff bard discipline
- find the grave of the butcher, which has been partially ransacked (some bones removed)
- plant lore - nature of the accident, the butcher's murders, the composition
- puzzle: [dance of doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8buda2/the_dance_of_doors_puzzleriddle_for_an_upcoming/) (read aloud the riddle as a song)
	- use suggestion in comments
Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.
- https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/dungeon-checklist.html
- https://theangrygm.com/babys-first-dungeon-1/

### The Cult of Song
- Leanna is the cult leader
	- Disgraced after the Strigoia debacle, trying to get back into Shrewseer's good graces. Trying to destabilize the city so Shrewseer can come seize power
	- Hates Eletha for being born into status
	- Dressed as a widow. 8 ft tall, black mourning dress, full veil over head. flips hair, eyes like chips of ice, curled lip
	- stats: necrichor, remnant cultist, drow mage?
- Possessing elysian fog users to carry out assassinations against prominent Kevarans
- Grave goods are doped with bone from the Butcher, so that smokers get possessed
- Butcher has captured Alara as a sacrifice for his final composition - the cultists are gonna do a ritual
==Council Contact - who?
- Gave Leanna necromantic powers in return for her searching for the Lance of Kevar in the catacombs
	- or taught leanna the ritual, she plundered fog to get more powers?
	- TODO: clues for this
	- hint at dragons, kevar's lance
Playing a cultist
- Cultist/assassins profess to be composing for the eternal melody
	- the songs of the dead are the most beautiful of all / may your dying screams join the eternal chorus / for the final composition
- Concentration save (WIS or CON?) when they take damage - possession temporarily ends if they fail, the remaining person has gaps in their memory
	- may remember getting on the ferry to go to Arda, can't remember the reason
	- aren't able to play instrument/sing normally
- 

### The Butcher Balladeer
- student who auditioned for second violin on the Sirenian players - but was rejected in favor of guitar player Coriolis
	- the troupe decided to downsize their classical music budget in favor of appealing to the youths - went for rock opera instead
- started murdering teachers + students, discovered the screams of the dead were a musical inspiration
- super emo, goth kid, screamo music
- plays the shrieks of the dead on their violin - reskinned banshee
- Balladeer's violin - +1 casting focus with a shriek ability. Strung using the vocal cords of victims? goffick
