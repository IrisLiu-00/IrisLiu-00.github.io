	- wealthy ppl, companies suddenly very interested in using Luca's automata as weapons - possibly disastrous results, the bots only have the one setting to kill everything. appear towards endgame of adv, near breakdown of order
	- clockwork definitely knows from Feldspar that Kallista actually looks different - going to be chasing her

	- declaration of martial law?
	- sectors of the city are controlled by each duke, their private guard acts as policing - Vasilev pulls in the criminals?

- the archaeologists are planning a dig under the school / the cult is based there
	- specific passcode or sth to get in?

## The Show

- Read aloud
	- The curtain rises on a dimmed stage; in the background a painted set of a crumbling castle. With a thrum the violins spring to life, the glint of rosin and wood from the pit. A chorus onstage begins singing in wordless notes. There's a roll of sheet metal to mimic thunder, and an enormous monster winds onto stage - golden scales, leathery wings, spouting illusory flame - a dragon! As the dragon turns to menace the chorus, who break and scatter as the music swells, two new figures run onto stage. A woman holding a staff and dagger, and a man in a helm holding a long lance. 
	- The man shouts - 'tis too late, Arda! We have dallied, and the end is near.' The woman replies - 'You speak false, Kevar! With your lance and my sorcery, we shall see our fates are just.' And the man says, 'Verily. Today, this scourge - this evil - shall dieee~!; They break into song. With a clash of cymbals and the roll of drums, the heroes leap into mock-battle. 
	- You all are sitting comfortably in a very nice private box, viewing this performance of *The Ballad of Kevar and Arda*, presented by the Sirenian Players. To your left is the Duke Vasilev, who brought you all to this performance tonight and secured your seats. He is sipping a glass of wine and idly watching the show - how have you all been finding the performance?
- Slight commotion in nearby box - a number of young, well dressed ppl shuffle around their seats as someone enters their box, looks like a dwarf woman. This dwarf enters, trailing a wreath of smoke that smells like old paper, or maybe like ripe peaches, or maybe like ocean air. That dwarf, you've been told, is a graverobber. The smoke she is holding in a long pipe is what you are here for. 
- That dwarf has information you are seeking; how do you get to her?
- Vasilev brought them here to find an in with the graverobbers
	- Vasilev wants souls to spoof votes in upcoming election
	- 600gp for the job
- The play has stuff abt divine intervention etc

### Filroy and Friends
- 2 guards outside the box, wearing orange + blue of house Filroy. Will prevent strangers from entering.
- Lordlings will be initially distrustful/supercilious of PCs, do not recognize them and want them to leave. 
- Carolus - wreathed in pearly smoke, holding a long pipe. Whoa, dudes, I think I was like, a really cool mysterious pirate in that one. 
	- Damien - that's nothing, three weeks ago I got one of the imperial conquerors. Nothing like tearing through the countryside with a soulsforge axe, just cutting through swathes of enemies
- Carolus Filroy: Duke Filroy's young nephew. Ringleader of the bunch. Self absorbed, superior, superficial. Riding on the power of his uncle. 
	- voice: crunch moon jones. Lots of "like". Kind of rhotic, west coast voice
	- appearance: flop of light blond hair, unbuttoned doublet, very nice pantaloons
	- only cares for others as far as they can entertain or do something for him
	- Lord Filroy has increased his investments in some young upstart inventor, expect he will be very grateful to our generosity
- Damien: nasal, nasty, jealous of others' closeness to Carolus. Family is high up in Isidor enterprises
- Suletta: shamelessly flirting with either Carolus or Damien. (is this...sexist....) bubbly personality.
- Torek: old woman, dwarf. Woman of few words. Gruff. 
	- thick glasses, lots of shawls and beads. Holding a case containing stuff for Elysian Fog
	- Was a practicing necromancer, started working with the historical society, got possessed + became a cultist.
	- Doesn't really want to talk abt the graverobbers / the historical society for fear of revealing things
	- Not directly involved in extracting grave goods, just does the postprocessing
	- Most young lords have been purchasing from Ornsgrym. Ornsgrym will be public at the send off of a Kevara diplomat tmr, most likely will also be selling. 
- Play concludes, a Felichian priest speaks
	- Curtain falls, leader of the company comes on stage. Thanks to the Felichian church for sponsoring this season's performances
	- Felichian priestess - the tale of Kevar and Arda and their conquest of the darkness is as pertinent today as it was five hundred years ago. Just as their paths were guided by Felichias those many millennia ago, so too can we trust the gods to guide our fates today. ==do some dramatic irony, the attacks happen
- assassination attempt
- things they can find out
	- the assassin - has just smoked. Only talks about the composition or is catatonic. Removing possession leaves them with no memory of events
	- specific things they can find out from each npc
- there's an opposing spy against V? or what's v doing while all they is going down, are they conspiring on sth


### Elysian Fog
- Small ceramic jars, each labelled + filled w ash. Torek takes a very small pinch and packs into the end of a long pipe. Snaps her gnarled fingers above the bowl of the pipe, a small spark falls into it. 
- Nacreous, shimmering, thick smoke, taken by a long pipe (like opium pipe)
- Taking a drag fills you with a heady, floaty feeling, and you start to see faces and scenery in the smoke surrounding you. The release of being anyone but yourself. It smokes clean, there's no low after effects wear off. 
	- similar to possession, but not technically true possession because the original soul is not there
- Souls leave an imprint on bodily remains, process via ritual into flammable substance
- Possession: DC10 WIS save against possession, increases by 2 for every usage of the smoke

1hr 1d4 bonus to some sort of check
price scales based on how desirable / rare the figure was
adventurers, nobles, kerrigan the mage, performers?, the great leviathan captain Azolar Avila buried with his first mate and all his deckhands in the ribcage of his leviathan, criminals?, a retainer in the old Duke Vasilev court?, warrior (during empire invasion), a religious figure?

### The Sirenian Players

## The Brightides Festival
- festival for the start of the trading season - when the trade winds turn
- priests provide readings of the signs for the city and individuals
- Sixpoints plaza in Kings' End - cordoned off, have the PCs figure out how to get in (challenges against? the automata, guards)
- ==this is a weak concept! Semireligious ceremony for safe travels? get some city magic in there

	- make this the murder victim - gyrfalcon?

- Patrician is there, mostly useless. Speech about the Fray
- Assassination on Ornsgrym, some merchants, Patrician (unsuccessful)
- Lord Fitzroy tries to hire the PCs to investigate Vasilev - noticeably absent from the event
	- trying to kick her out of the lord's table?
- should there be a combat encounter here? depending on if PCs try to stop assassins
	- challenge - if PCs try to prevent assassins while also staying undercover

## Clockwork's Trap
- either usurps Merriwink's thieves or Kallista school
- Merriwink says she has a tip about the graverobbers - in return for some sort of fetch quest?
- do the Kerrigan fight here?

	- stats: necrichor, remnant cultist, drow mage?
- Possessing cultists to carry out assassinations against prominent Kevarans

	- TODO: clues for this

### The Butcher Balladeer
- student who auditioned for second violin on the Sirenian players - but was rejected in favor of guitar player Coriolis
	- the troupe decided to downsize their classical music budget in favor of appealing to the youths - went for rock opera instead
- started murdering teachers + students, discovered the screams of the dead were a musical inspiration
- french, pretentious art student vibes - critique screams for being of key
- plays the shrieks of the dead on their violin - reskinned banshee
### Layout
- 3 levels, 3 areas in each level
- find the artificer's code
- Final face off: Leanna + ghost in lair
- reduced threat ghosts as prior monsters in the dungeon - victims of the slasher

- have cultists run away to alert others (retreat on round 2, alert on round 3)
- bad guys target the light armored ones first
- resting -> chance of a random encounter?
- have the cultists take a captive to rescue?
- secret treasure room behind a riddle
Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.
