Goals
- a longer adventure, multiple stages
- more player agency
- ending should introduce the big bad (council)

Big Picture
- start planting the artificer's code (symbols for letters, RTL text)
- relate to quest for engine piece, history of city
- give a chance to learn about Vasilev's backstory
- plant seeds for Vasilev's election gambit

- they're trying to manipulate positioning for the Avizallo diplomacy trip
	- V is trying to put bridgers on the party to go to Avizallo (as mercs?)
	- V is trying to manipulate Ornsgrym out of the diplomat's party - but Giltstern steps in and sends luca as a proxy instead? or Giltstern/Feldspar goes?
	- idk the point of this if it doesn't directly affect players or give them agency
- what do all the factions think: V, lords, Patrician, merchers, bridgers, merrow, avizallo
	- V - focused on getting grave goods for the election
	- lords move to outlaw drugs, but ppl who have used in the past are still possessed
	- rival lord offers a job to investigate V - thinks she is behind the assassinations. Then assassination attempt on V
	- merchers
	- bridgers try to get in on the drug trade, don't care much about assassinations
	- avizallo
	- 

More assassination attempts - requires PCs to be in public situations
- it shouldn't be immediately clear that the assassins are all smokers
- PCs are called on as security detail? for liasons with elves or avizallo? guard a saltwood shipment?
- attempt on Patrician's life - assailant dies
- nobles hire automata - potential encounter where automata go out of control or sth
- attempt on Vasilev - someone infiltrates her house. why would the PCs be in her house at night
- if they still don't care, attempt to kill the PCs

Info the PCs need to find the dungeon
- assassination attempts are connected to the smoke
- the archaeological society is a front for the cult
- the archaeologists are planning a dig under the school / the cult is based there

# Scenes

## Downtime
Shopping - PCs have abt 1800gp
- Mik's Marketplace -  All items are unique unless otherwise specified. 
	- Potion of Healing: 50gp, 2 in stock. 
	- All or Nothing Coin: 80gp. This duplicitous coin can spell fortune or ruin for its owner. When making an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can flip a coin in place of rolling a d20. Heads is treated as a 20, while tails is treated as a 1. The coin cannot be used again until the next dawn.
	- Mockingbird Gum: 140gp. These green and blue speckled minty sticks of chewing gum come in a pack of 5 sticks. As an action, you can eat one stick of gum and gain the ability to imitate another creatureâ€™s voice for 1 hour. A creature that hears you can tell that the voice is an imitation by making a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check.
	- Immovable Rod: 230gp. This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
	- Band of Projected Thought: 250gp. While wearing this headband, you can telepathically communicate with any creature that speaks at least one language within 30 feet.
- Ass Play Work Orders
- Other items
	- armor, poisons?
Ask everyone what they're doing in downtime
- Fray tide looms over the city for the next few weeks, an ever present cloud bank at the city's eastern port. Sailors mutter bad omens, mages curse lapsing spells, and the common folk stay inside. Despite the city's protections that have stood against the Fray for millennia, no resident of the Leuchroic coast has ever made it long without learning a healthy fear of the sea. 
- Headlines on the next issue of the Gisney Times
	- events of last adventure. tie into Vasilev's plans if you have them
Scene with bluemoon learning artificing
- Luca's workshop: gleaming chrome and brass, dials, puffs of whistling steam. Drawers and bins of parts - gears, wires of different gauges, crystal shards. Slightly disarrayed, except for one workbench kept very neat order, but Luca approaches his own bench.
- Pass thru assembly floor - bustling with machinists assembling rows of automata
	- Suddenly a lot of demand for work - word really got out from that bridge debacle. Any publicity is good publicity
	- Nobles + merchants ordering for private security - would have really preferred a less militaristic approach, but they're working on better safety guards
- Misurium crystal engraving and reading of data
	- silvery, transparent crystals with a liquid sheen
	- old wizards and artificers used them to store research and spells so that laypeople could not read them
	- the great artificer Piranes discovered that multiple misurium crystals lined up in sequence could be used to read and write data, or make decisions based on it
- convo
	- Adventurers don't tend to hang out in big cities, do they? what keeps you all here
	- suspicious of Vasilev
	- insp - it's about being the best
- What gadgets is bluemoon working on?
Scene with Merriwink testing Toby?
- Merriwink's trainee tries to pickpocket Toby
	- Goliath named Jacky just tries to straight up threaten/shake loose toby's money
	- Merriwink comes out to stop him - they've been having a deficit of proper apprentices lately
- Becoming an inductee of the Thieves' Guild (Society of Economic Liberation) requires passing certain trials
	- first one is to steal 200gp worth of gold and contribute it to the Society



## The Show

- Read aloud
	- The curtain rises on a dimmed stage; in the background a painted set of a crumbling castle. With a thrum the violins spring to life, the glint of rosin and wood from the pit. A chorus onstage begins singing in wordless notes. There's a roll of sheet metal to mimic thunder, and an enormous monster winds onto stage - golden scales, leathery wings, spouting illusory flame - a dragon! As the dragon turns to menace the chorus, who break and scatter as the music swells, two new figures run onto stage. A woman holding a staff and dagger, and a man in a helm holding a long lance. 
	- The man shouts - 'tis too late, Arda! We have dallied, and the end is near.' The woman replies - 'You speak false, Kevar! With your lance and my sorcery, we shall see our fates are just.' And the man says, 'Verily. Today, this scourge - this evil - shall dieee~!; They break into song. With a clash of cymbals and the roll of drums, the heroes leap into mock-battle. 
	- You all are sitting comfortably in a very nice private box, viewing this performance of *The Ballad of Kevar and Arda*, presented by the Sirenian Players. To your left is the Duke Vasilev, who brought you all to this performance tonight and secured your seats. He is sipping a glass of wine and idly watching the show - how have you all been finding the performance?
- Slight commotion in nearby box - a number of young, well dressed ppl shuffle around their seats as someone enters their box, looks like a dwarf woman. This dwarf enters, trailing a wreath of smoke that smells like old paper, or maybe like ripe peaches, or maybe like ocean air. That dwarf, you've been told, is a graverobber. The case she's holding is what you are here for. 
- That dwarf has information you are seeking; how do you get to her?
- Vasilev brought them here to find an in with the graverobbers
	- Vasilev wants souls to spoof votes in upcoming election
	- 800gp for the job
- The play has stuff abt divine intervention etc

### Filroy and Friends
- 2 guards outside the box, wearing orange + blue of house Filroy. Will prevent strangers from entering.
- Lordlings will be initially distrustful/supercilious of PCs, do not recognize them and want them to leave. 
- Carolus - wreathed in pearly smoke, holding a long pipe. Whoa, dudes, I think I was like, a really cool mysterious pirate in that one. 
	- Damien - that's nothing, three weeks ago I got one of the imperial conquerors. Nothing like tearing through the countryside with a soulsforge axe, just cutting through swathes of enemies
	- Show the smokers getting ability bonuses
- Carolus Filroy: Duke Filroy's young nephew. Ringleader of the bunch. Self absorbed, superior, superficial. Riding on the power of his uncle. 
	- voice: crunch moon jones. Lots of "like", "dude". Open mouth, back of the mouth, rhotic, californian
	- appearance: flop of light blond hair, unbuttoned doublet, very nice pantaloons
	- stats: noble
	- only cares for others as far as they can entertain or do something for him
	- Lord Filroy has increased his investments in some young upstart inventor, expect he will be very grateful to our generosity
- Damien: nasal, nasty, jealous of others' closeness to Carolus. Family is high up in Isidor enterprises
	- smoking heavily
	- Does not like the show - saw much better last spring
- Lauswa: young orc woman. Bored at having to associate with these Kevarans
	- voice: broad, long vowels. Dentalised THs
	- Daughter of a commanding Langksaran officer in occupied Khamgard
- Torek: old woman, dwarf necromancer. Woman of few words. Gruff. 
	- thick glasses, lots of shawls and beads. Holding a case containing stuff for Elysian Fog
	- "newly excavated, newly ritualized. very good. these prices, you see them nowhere else."
	- Was a practicing necromancer, started working with the historical society - not possessed, but willing to cover for the cultists for the sake of money
	- Doesn't really want to talk abt the graverobbers / the historical society for fear of revealing things
	- Not directly involved in extracting grave goods, just does the postprocessing
	- Most young lords have been purchasing from Ornsgrym. Ornsgrym will be public at the send off of a Kevara diplomat tmr, most likely will also be selling. 
	- Can speak on the nature of elysian fog - origins, how it's made
- Perception check for what's going on V
	- speaking with Ornsgrym? hands him a glass of wine
- Play concludes, a Felichian priest speaks
	- Curtain falls, leader of the company comes on stage. Thanks to the Felichian church for sponsoring this season's performances
	- Felichian priestess - the tale of Kevar and Arda and their conquest of the darkness is as pertinent today as it was five hundred years ago. Just as their paths were guided by Felichias those many millennia ago, so too can we trust the gods to guide our fates today. 
- Assassination attempt
	- if PCs don't notice (Pcpt DC18), Damien gets a surprise round, then roll initiative
	- Damien pulls out a knife to slit Carolus's throat - trying to cut out his vocal cords
	- "enough of this derivative dribble- let's make something interesting"
- If they subdue Damien
	- "for the Composition!"
	- Only talks about the composition or is catatonic. Removing possession leaves them with no memory of events

Pick up here
- Damien fainted, is pinned under the Rod
	- Damien comes to in a bit, confused about what happened. Just felt like the opera singing was really annoying, got pissed. 
	- Carolus: Damien has always had asthma, is prone to fits - will ask attendants to keep a closer eye on him
- Torek: anyone who wants to buy Elysian fog should go thru Ornsgrym, she does not handle sales
	- she tries to sneak out? roll against pass pcpt
- another assassination attempt against V - 2 is coincidence, 3 is a pattern
	- Lauswa is assailant?


### Elysian Fog
- Small ceramic jars, each labelled + filled w ash. Torek takes a very small pinch and packs into the end of a long pipe. Mutters some words over it, snaps her gnarled fingers above the bowl of the pipe, a small spark falls into it. 
- Nacreous, shimmering, thick smoke, taken by a long pipe (like opium pipe)
- Taking a drag fills you with a heady, floaty feeling, and you start to see faces and scenery in the smoke surrounding you. The release of being anyone but yourself. It smokes clean, there's no low after effects wear off. 
	- similar to possession, but not technically true possession because the original soul is not there
- Souls leave an imprint on bodily remains, process via ritual into flammable substance
	- necromantic ritual to select + amplify bits of memory
Mechanics 
- let them make a check to see which benefits each smoke gives
- Seacaptain (80gp) - the great leviathan captain Azolar Avila buried with his first mate and all his deckhands in the ribcage of his leviathan
	- feet planted on the rolling back of a sea monster, hobnailed boots digging into its hide. A burst of cold sea air on your face. Laughing and quaffing ale with your sailors as you break into chests of treasure. Swinging from a rope across the spiny sail. The flash of rapiers dancing across the deck of a burning ship. The cool darkness of ocean depths, looking out of your breathing bubble at shadows of sea life.
	- 1d4 to DEX checks+saves for 1hr
- Warrior (60gp) - an orcish soldier during the Langksaran conquest
	- Looking out across a plain as four tusked war oliphants march. Searing pain as a broadsword slices into your side. Your first glimpse of the monumental statues framing the port of Kevara Arda, your breath caught in your throat. Roars and cheers following the palanquin of your emperor. Flame and triumph as you broach the gates of the Patrician's hill in Kevara. 
	- 1d4 to strength checks for 1hr
- Courtesan (55gp) - some well to do minor noble of the old Duke V's court
	- Silks and satin and human skin. Spiraling lights in a ballroom, the clink of crystal. Laughs and sideways glances and words unsaid. A shadow upon a dais - a human man in a black and silver trimmed robe, closely followed by a drow boy in black. 
	- 1d4 to insight checks for 1hr
- Mage (70gp) - kerrigan the mage? unconfirmed, possibly an apprentice
	- Lightning striking a high, lonely tower. Books with crackling pages written in languages only you can understand. The knowledge that space and mass are but shadows cast upon the mortal world. Rippling the fabric of reality with your hands. 
	- 1d4 to INT checks+saves for 1hr
- Possession: DC10 WIS save against possession, increases by 2 for every usage of the smoke


### The Sirenian Players
- Alara: human woman, playing Arda
- Garthik: half orc man, playing Kevar
- Elind: small, dark, lively halfling woman with short hair. Troupe leader
- potentially can speak about the school?
- do these guys have involvements w the fog? the church? the nobles?

## The Brightides Festival

### About
- The Fray clears! The sky is blue again, musical rattling sound as the statues lower the Fray nets
- Festival for the start of the trading season - early autumn, marks when the trade winds turn
	- Kevara-Arda is an engine that runs on trade, and they mark time by it. 
	- The great shipping boats will soon start making their circuit around the interior of the Leuchroic sea - laden with grains from the fertile Laamveldt, they'll sail east past the gates of Kevara-Arda to the coasts of the inland empire, Langksa. Along the way they'll pick up spices and textiles from the Sutherlands, as the lively clipper ships of the southern poet kings stream their way through the strait. The trading companies will make their way north to the frost-bitten mountains for dwarven craftwork and ores, then down past the misty coast of the Mirwood, until they return at the end of spring, hulls sitting low in the water with exotic goods and gold, to weather out the rainy season until the cycle starts again. 
- Sixpoints plaza in Kings' End - six streets leading to a star shaped plaza
	- streets cleaned - scalecobbles (large, round flagstones) burnished to a bright bronze
	- clustered with people, densely packed stalls, games, performances. Priests weave between, swinging smoking censers to give blessings, nobles processions in palanquins
	- colorful wind socks flapping in the air, decorated like dolphins and whales and leviathans
- Ornsgrym has been buying and selling the Elysian fog to other nobles, but Stevian has the actual contacts with the manufacturers.
	- Stevian is missing - went to get poison and distribute to assassins.
- Gyrfalcon mistrusts the Kevarans, believes they're making an unfair deal for the saltwood
	- are they actually doing anything relevant tho

	- Elind pacing around frantically, stopping people and asking if they've seen a human woman with red hair. The show's on in 10 minutes! Also has anyone seen Zircon's flute??
	- Alara came to Sixpoints early yesterday to set up the stage, was noticed by cultists
		- Met people working for one of the Dukes (Stevian) to organize permits for the stage
		- Told them she met an old friend (was charmed?) working for an Archaeological society - friend was a schoolmate at Bridgewater, convinced her to go back to visit 
	- Performance is a lot of traditional folk songs, skits from the Kevara-Ardan Cycle
	- Perf check to see how much money they get, and if they get noticed by a cultist
### Sixpoints Plaza
- Priests of Felichias giving readings of the signs for the coming trade season
	- Open air area around a wide metal brazier. Two guards around the perimeter, several priests clad in white + gold robes clustered around the fire. 
	- inscribe a question onto soft driftwood, throw in the flame > priest interprets the sparks/colors
	- things to foreshadow 
		- travel to the heart of the whiteness
		- sth abt Toby and his father
	- Father Thrain - shaggy, smiling minotaur priest. Jokester.
	- If Lumdas comes - priests recognize him, interrogate his faith. He never comes to temple, never does anything

	- halfway thru the griffon starts screeching and someone chuckles
	- Coughing fit > a guard moves aside to let a attendant bring him some water

		- Automata goes on fire (1d4 dmg per turn)
	- all automata start with shockwave effect
	- Initiative 0 fire spreads
	- automata will fire at any sus activity, animals turn violent, assassins try to kill their targets then flee
- if they don't get enough info, Filroy asks them to investigate Vasilev > do another assassination, let them capture Stevian or whatever

Interrogating Stevian
- Stevian has been taken to a city watch post near Sixpoints - is in a jail cell
- stevian/ghost won't willingly tell ppl the location of the archaeologists, but the butcher will be prepared that ppl are searching or them
- On his body - violin, a long narrow pipe, a receipt for an Elysian Fog order with an address in Arda
	- Violin stamped with The Sirenian Players, initials A.L.


## Clockwork's Trap
- Old ironworks - brick building, dusty windows. Wide open floor w vats they used to melt ore
- Steel mesh catwalk stretches above - a hint of movement
	- Merriwink may call out to Toby if hesitant
- Clockwork on the platform at the end of the catwalk, Merriwink tied up behind him
	- ==checking his pocket watch
	- Extort for information about Kallista - where did she come from, who has she talked to
	- Get into a fight - call her here alone and I'll let you go
	- ==what is Toby thinking or feeling as this happens?
	- Rolls up his sleeves, exposing manacled wrists, connected to a chain. One end of the chain goes to his pocket watch in his hand. The other end he draws outwards from his duster, the links clinking as they move. He swings it with a slow, indolent menace, and you see that at that other end is an ornate, curlicued metal point - the sharpened hand of an enormous clock. 
	- Timed explosion can blow out the stairs - it's a 30 foot drop to the bottom
	- anything to prevent him running away?

Pick up here
- what's going on in Kallista's mind, as her friends unexpectedly swing in for her?
- Clockwork can backflip out a window once it goes bad for him

## The Kevara-Arda Archaeological Society
- basically a bunch of graverobbers - used to be a ragtag association of ppl trying to steal and sell treasure, recently ballooned due to demand for Elysian fog
- Located Arda side - they can take a ferry to cross

First Floor
- Front + back entrance
	- Front entrance goes to a reception desk to buy an entry ticket (2gp), manned by Quercus
	- Back entrance is for adventurers bringing in loot - goes to a cargo elevator to the second floor
- Quercus: gnome cultist, crotchety old man with round glasses, hair growing out nostrils. Quivery old man voice. 
	- humming a tune absently - no, it's C then A then G sharp
	- Overbearing, tells ppl not to touch anything. 
	- Flute stored under desk, but originally does not know music
- Tiny, dusty little museum, flickering lighting, moldering artifacts behind glass cases, paper labels with spidery, faded ink
- Displaying most prominent findings from the catacombs
	- Centerpiece - bones of a juvenile war oliphaunt from the Langksaran conquest, ~800 yrs ago
	- Old suit of armor missing a few pieces
	- Pottery shards + such
	- Any organic remains have already been removed - a mummy
- Narrow staircase to the side goes upstairs, cordoned off w a velvet rope. Receptionist will try to stop visitors from passing thru
	- see another elderly archaeologist come in thru back entrance + go up the steps

Second Floor
- Rows of desks, shelves on all four sides with lots of labelled compartments holding artifacts + samples (cloth fragments, pottery shards)
	- A few older men and women inspecting artifacts under magnifying glasses, flipping thru old texts
	- One half of the room is cleared out, with a large magic circle drawn on the floor. Traces of bone dust. Ritual knife, etc. Where they get the necromancers to process Elysian Fog. 
	- One jar of bone dust near the magic circle, labeled with "Catacombs X37, Arda, Bridgewater underground" scratched out name "Brayden Blackwood"
- Small stack of crates, filled with Elysian Fog packets to be shipped out
	- powders have been doped with Butcher's ashes
- Lyell and Ringley working behind one desk - Lyell examining old parchments with a pair of gloves, muttering under his breath. Ringley trying to balance a parchment airplane on his nose. 
	- Here as consultants to make some money - archaeologists want them to find potential dig sites from the age of Kevar and Arda, but that seems really unlikely. Mention Kevar's lance?
	- Saw Alara come here on the day of the festival with Stevian - they said they were going to visit their alma mater Bridgewater later
	- Lyell can explain the nature of the fog - possession
- Woman's handbag, empty violin case (Alara Lightfoot's) - some money, lines for the Ballad of Kevar/Arda, cosmetics
- Maps on the walls - plotted out locations of catacomb entrances. Numerous locations Xed out, already plundered. One at Bridgewater seems heavily annotated. One under Ass Play?
	- Bridgewater dig site was marked out two months ago - university building that collapsed in an unspecified accident, but possibly exposed tunnels to the catacombs
- Scrolls with research materials - large pile about Arda side urban legends that was abandoned a while ago
	- Balladeer Butcher - a slasher about 80 yrs ago who killed a number of musicians + music students, often removing their vocal cords
- Other scholars will try to stop players if they notice them, call Quercus and start fight

Fight
- Quercus plays his flute and animates the museum exhibits to start dancing
	- "you're too late to come find me - by tomorrow night, she will be dead and the composition complete"
- Potentially have the oliphaunt blow out the floor, drop the PCs - dex save for fall dmg
- Monsters
	- Quercus (cultist), oliphaunt (dino skeleton), suit of armor (dread warrior), swarm of pottery shards? (hoard scarabs) use minion rules?
	- Ringley, Lyell (scholarly agent)??
- fight some cultists, reward w info
	- either Quercus or some other cultist has a Bridgewater campus map, with the location of ISEC circled
	- Quercus has jotted some sheet music - short tune, password to the dungeon
- ==lowkey make this shorter. skip the fight?==

## The Dungeon
### The School
- Bridgewater U: Arda-side university
- Motely collection of brownstone + granite buildings, in the shadow of a bridge-like aqueduct cutting thru city
- Near the border of the Khamgaard occupation
- Yu - changeling prof for performance arts
	- gracile woman with pale skin, dark hair
	- met Alara briefly the other day, said she was going to come back to catch up but did not reappear
### Background
- Basements of the collapsed ISEC (Instrumental Soundcraft and Elocution Center)
- Built ~80 years ago when the school tried to revitalize its image, rapidly abandoned when a mysterious accident collapsed the whole building
	- The Butcher nearly completed his shriek metal black grunge composition - his first rehearsal brought the building down, killing a lot of students/teachers who were in it
- Basement is still intact and is connected to an unexplored section of the catacombs
- Supposedly very haunted
- All the undead are victims of the slasher, bound into service
### Layout
- Resting -> chance of random encounter
- secret entrance from Yu? some cool way to get in
#### Level 1 - ISEC Basement
Entrance
- Edge of campus, not frequented by ppl. Once an imposing building of dark onyx stone, built in a modernistic style (geometric abstract shapes). Now a collapsed wreck, a lot of the valuable facade decoration picked off by scavengers, the remaining ruin jutting into the air like broken teeth
- Patrol with 2 cultists in bushes around entrance  - perception on both sides to see who notices
	- either sneak past or get into combat
	- If combat, second cultist will escape inwards to the first encounter > ambush on second lvl
- Entrance: part of the rubble forms a triangular shaped doorway, leading into intact staircase down
- Secret entrance: ? from yu?
Atrium
- tiled floor, burnt out fluorescent lights. Darkness. Doorway on left (to band hall) and on right (recording studio).
Band rehearsal hall
- Skeletones: seven skeletons, each with a strange glyph on their shield (Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti). Resurrect themselves unless killed in correct order
	- make the onomatopoeia for their note when the skeleton is hit
- Treasure: defeated skeletons can be harvested
- Skeletones manhandled Alara + forced her into the tombs - fragment of bright blue silk on a rusty music stand next to closet door
- Tensorat's crystal here - one of the skeletons picked it up
	- was here hunting for Coriolis ~90 years ago, left a datacrystal. Konrad can help decipher
- Closet: knocked down pile of bricks exposes staircase to L2 Atrium
Destroyed recording studio
- Medium size room, bisected by a wall with a large glass window. Glass window has been shattered, shards flung outward + embedded in the wall. Outer room has some strange machinery - a bank of dials + buttons stands against the dividing wall, totally fried. Inner room blackened + disintegrating - punctured, rubble collapsing in from ground floor, bottom of this room fallen thru. Through the gaps in rubble, can barely see dark stone corridors of a lower layer. 
- 2 ritual magics happened here - an old one (traces written in common), a recent one (traces written in elvish)
	- old blood, candles, drawn runes
	- where the Butcher tried to record his song, collapsing the whole building + where Leana resurrected
- Rubble + ash is positioned so that there is a clear spot where something once laid (butcher's body) - stuff has been pushed aside, the thing dragged or crawled out. A separate act of necromancy happened here.
- Treasure: Rehearser's Ring, fell off the Butcher's hand when he climbed out
- Athletics check to climb down to L2, take some dmg if fail?
#### Level 2 - The Butcher's Lair
Atrium
- If patrol was alerted, 4 cultists attack here (from each doorway?), one more posted at studio stairs down?
	- or combine into another encounter so it's not too much? command the skeletons?
- Pile of rubble leading up to recording studio
- Doorways to butcher's studio, dance studio
Dance studio
- A room with high arched ceiling made of stone. More recently installed polished wooden floors, mirrored walls on 2 sides with mounted handrails. As you enter, a chain of runes glows at the edges of the mirrors, and their surfaces ripple like water.
- Attacks and creatures can move thru mirrors to reappear on other side
- ==mechanics - do cool stuff with the mirrors, give the ghouls dance based abilities?==
- Dance ghouls 
	- Were killed by the Butcher like the other undead, and recently bound into his service. Need to prevent intruders from entering. 
	- high mobility, cast kinetic jaunt
	- Glenda: halfling young woman, the leader. Disco. Rainbow leg warmers, little fluffy drop shoulder cardigan sweater. Skin on face decomposed, exposing teeth.
	- Andrei: Drow male. Tap dance. Skin tight white tanktop, black tights, glossy patent leather shoes.
	- Malachite: Green dragonborn. Breakdance. Floppy beanie hat, cool sneakers.
	- Suella: Human woman. Ballet. Tutu, ballet flats. 
	- "and a 1, and a 2, and a 1-2-3-4 - let's groove!"
- Mirrors disappear when the ghouls die, expose another ghost ward fragment
secret treasure room behind a riddle
- stepping on the right flagstones- multicolored stones, do a dance. maybe make this good for the str/dex ppl? the original puzzle was broken from its function
- curse them to speak in rhymes - the mute and the blind?
- Songster's Absinthe - used by singers, gives the benefits of a full rest (check how low they are on hp). One dose for everyone
- Another ghost ward fragment
- Yu is hanging around here - has been alternatively posing as a cultist or some monster scaring the cultists. challenge the PCs to get the reward?
	- ask them abt their employer - she used to know vasilev
	- tell me a story, true or false
The Butcher's Studio
- Small stone cellar. Overflowing piles of old yellow parchment, scrawled with musical notation. Pile of rotting rags in the corner (a cot). Wood carvers and planers (luthier's tools), scraps of ebony wood, tweezers and scalpels, bone saw. Some human remains (fragment of a orbital rim, fingers + toes).
- Once anyone steps inside: roll initiative. white and ebony instruments start playing an unearthly tune that makes you feel like your soul is being yanked out of body
	- deal 1d4 continuous damage until stopped
	- violin strung w human hair, lute with body made of skull, flute made of thigh bone, xylophone made of rib cage
	- silence them, destroy instruments, comfort the souls (return bones to the corpses)
- Desiccated corpses: mummified with tufts of missing hair, skeleton w/o rib cage, body w/o head, body w/o leg
- Near entrance: etched runes (musical notation) that have been erased/covered up with some other dark putrefied liquid (runes of a different sort crawling over the wall)
	- Ghost wards were created more recently than the stone of the catacombs itself, and they were destroyed even more recently
	- Bards building the ISEC tried to sanctify the catacombs and install ghost wards - prevent dead from rising, prevent them from moving around (and coming into the school buildings)
	- Magic that destroyed the wards is diff from the bardic craft in the rest of the room - it's wizardly necromantic magic
- Healing potion within the stuff
- Stairs down to L3 Labyrinth
#### Level 3 - The Deep Catacombs
Labyrinth
- narrow stone corridors, dripping water, emptied burial niches. From the distance, high mournful singing.
- Singing ghosts in a labyrinth (reduced threat ghosts)
- Shortcut exit: rusted portcullis, glimpse another ghost ward fragment on the opposing wall
	- Piece together melody, performance dc 15 to prevent ghosts from entering area
	- Portcullis AC, HP, dmg threshold
- Primary exit: still-functional ghost ward locks the ghosts out. Goes to next room
- map: double scale on owlbear
- periodically hear the butcher singing/shredding?
[Dance of Doors](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/8buda2/the_dance_of_doors_puzzleriddle_for_an_upcoming/) puzzle
- 7 flat stone doors, each identical except their knobs. From left to right:
	1. A clear glass knob, hollow and thin (like a light bulb), but empty
	2. An ivory knob, slightly speckled, round and smooth
	3. A reddish-brown wooden knob with paisley-like carvings
	4. A scuffed up brass knob cast into the visage of a troll
	5. A paper-mache knob made to look like parchment crumpled into a ball
	6. A reddish-brown wooden knob with paisley-like carvings
	7. An oval sandstone knob, coarse and gritty
- Voice boom, repeat in several languages (common, elvish, dwarvish // halfling, goblin, orcish) (stupid bard voice). Hourglass turns (15 minutes) until the ghosts break their way thru
	```
	The Dance of Doors, the Dance of Doors, a merry time for all!
	Six are cruel and punishing, but one is your windfall!
	
	This useless rhyme and waltz cannot begin
	until you stand facing the right-most twin.
	
	Now, I give the first of only two useful clues
	The door before you is a deadly one to choose.
	
	Side-step left until you reach what's from an elephant's head
	then side-step right again, but half that distance instead
	
	See? See how far you are to the failed writings of a frustrated bard?
	Double your distance from it, if that is not too hard.
	
	Now's the time to turn! But not a knob like you're inclined to,
	but instead, yourself, until the door's behind you.
	
	Move left two doors, now face your new partner, 
	Move right two and bow (you're quite the charmer!)
	
	Once more left, and it's the end of our prance -
	There we go, it's over! Thank you for the dance.
	
	If you are confused, or perhaps even rattled - 
	Remember great artists take the path less travelled.
	```
- Turning the wrong knob: door does not open, 2d10 psychic damage, DC 12 WIS save for half
The Butcher's Tomb
- Tall cavernous room, pillars, carved niches with open sarcophagi, dripping water. 
- Large stone sarcophagus at far end. Partial corpse inside - a number of ribs are gone. Pale dessicated skin, limp black hair. Holding a ebony violin. ==but he didn't die here?==
	- figure out how leanna and the ghost make their entrance
- Butcher is retrying his ritual, somewhere more structurally sound!
- 4 broken ghost wards - performance DC15 at each to restore them.
	- Restoring all cuts off possession of cultists, does a chunk of dmg to butcher
- where is alara captured?
- cultists as infantry? remove cacophony ability

- plant lore - nature of the accident(ritual), the butcher's murders, the composition, leanna trying to find kevar's lance
- portcullis splits party, enemies attack
- reconstruct the tune of the ghost ward thru scattered fragments - playing it allows getting thru labyrinth shortcut, some sort of env interaction (activate 4 seals?) to deal extra dmg to butcher
- zones of silence for recording studio - prevents verbal spellcasting
Dungeon design
- each room should have at least two or three of the following aspects: lore, a mechanical challenge, a puzzle, and a reward.

### The Cult of Song
- Leanna is the cult leader
	- Disgraced after the Strigoia debacle, trying to get back into Shrewseer's good graces. Trying to destabilize the city so Shrewseer can come seize power
	- Hates Eletha for being born into status
	- Dressed as a widow. 8 ft tall, black mourning dress, full veil over head. flips hair, eyes like chips of ice, curled lip
	- stats: necrichor, remnant cultist, drow mage?
- Possessing elysian fog users to carry out assassinations against prominent Kevarans
- Grave goods are doped with bone from the Butcher, so that smokers get possessed
- Butcher has captured Alara as a sacrifice for his final composition - the cultists are gonna do a ritual
==Council Contact - who?
- Gave Leanna necromantic powers in return for her searching for the Lance of Kevar in the catacombs
	- or taught leanna the ritual, she plundered fog to get more powers?
	- TODO: clues for this
	- hint at dragons, kevar's lance
Playing a cultist
- Cultist/assassins profess to be composing for the eternal melody
	- the songs of the dead are the most beautiful of all / may your dying screams join the eternal chorus / for the final composition
- Concentration save (WIS or CON?) when they take damage - possession temporarily ends if they fail, the remaining person has gaps in their memory
	- may remember getting on the ferry to go to Arda, can't remember the reason
	- aren't able to play instrument/sing normally
### The Butcher Balladeer
- Brayden Blackwood: student who auditioned for second violin on the Sirenian players - but was rejected in favor of guitar player Coriolis
	- the troupe decided to downsize their classical music budget in favor of appealing to the youths - went for rock opera instead
	- dark eye circles - from eye makeup or being dead?
- started murdering teachers + students, discovered the screams of the dead were a musical inspiration
	- discovered entrance into catacombs, started using the area for his dark deeds
- super emo, goth kid, screamo music
- plays the shrieks of the dead on their violin - reskinned banshee
- still need at least two more virtuoso bards - ideally virgins (leanna: why the fuck does that matter? butcher: it just seems like the thing to do when you're running a cult, yknow)
