  

- 22.11.6 - Mazfroth's Mysteries, the smuggling trip
    - motivation for taking the smuggling quest was iffy
    - getting better at char voices, at least for silly faux-erudite affected voices
    - dialogue for enemy NPCs can be better - they should have some quirks
    - maintaining voice differentiation between NPCs continues to be a struggle
    - they said they liked the chase mechanics, but I had trouble keeping track of all the steps
    - PCs did not take advantage of environment / take creative actions as much as I wanted (though they did go for the goats)
        - I did not have NPCs use environment as much either
    - balancing and bookeeping HP was an issue - treating the kobolds as a semi swarm was tough
    - heavy hitters (sleep, killing the goats) hindered the enemies from taking as many actions
    - no payoff for creative choices on part of the players (their disguise as circus players)
    - write up a bulleted game log of what happened
- 22.11.13 - Mazfroth, Velouche battle
    - denouement was scrambled, didn't resolve narrative threads clearly or with enough weight
        - you're still bad at character dialogue
        - put off by the fact that they tried to make away with all the money
    - players are extremely gold focused - need to be careful about when you offer money, or build in motivations that are not money
    - Velouche's voice did not come off as you practiced
    - it's kind of boring to do a battle where parts are gatekeeped by ability checks - having to keep trying to climb the wall is annoying, slow
    - gave them a talk to try and convince them to do more character work, RP
        - players are currently mainly interested in fucking around and doing jokes
    - more exposition from mid battle enemy dialogue
- 23.1.21 - drunk dnd (The Blind Dragonet)
    - Overall quite good!
    - Players surprisingly liked the dice game, got competitive
        - Getting table to roleplay goblins got a lot of laughs
    - Players like making friends with animals, as usual - found Tootsie v cute
    - Entirely skipped the draco rat fight via speak with animals
        - Kallista’s persuasion/deception is getting very high - going to have to limit uses, create situations with higher DCs
    - Could have more effectively pushed the mystery of “who is Vonnegut” to get players to investigate more
    - Lost Evelyn’s shitty scottish accent halfway thru
    - Could continue to be better at managing multiple ppl trying to do diff things
    - Battles can be a slog
        - too few enemies (actions) > need to up the hp > battles take a long ass time
        - Use a map?
- 23.3.20 - Strigoia Heist pt 1
    - Theodore’s accent fell apart immediately - still need to rehearse
    - Control both timbre and accent
    - felt like a little bit too much expose at the start
    - Not all players got to do cool stuff - it’s easier for the face (K) and sneaky (T)
- 23.4.5 - Strigoia Heist pt 2
    - Generally kind of bad, boring
    - timing fell apart - got thru the prep scenes but didnt manage to have them form the actual plan. Not sure how we’ll handle next session
    - Improv was still quite bad, compounded by the fact that the players are not confident at dialogue either
    - They thought Shrewseer’s overdramatic personality was funny
    - Fell flat on playing Vasilev, on populating the world with interesting details
    - Succession of different scenes didn’t feel… very interesting? Seemed like the players were continually running up against walls, not having much fun. Too many scenarios with difficult, open ended challenges
        - Give them something easy, hack and slash next?
- 23.4.14 - Strigoia Heist pt 3
    - Kallista got onboarded to servants (hints of Ornsgrym coming onto Sadie), the others come in as performers (get assigned chaperone Wally, did performance, Eletha got servants clothes from Kallista)
    - Tentatively better than last time?
    - Players enjoy dicking around as always (coming up with costumes, etc)
    - need to get better at improvising results to failures - fail forward, mixed failures, mixed success
    - little bit too much screen time for Kallista?
    - challenges they’re going thru for the heist still seem kind of ill defined
    - Figure out a way to keep up the mood, tension of a heist
- 23.4.29 - Strigoia Heist pt 4
    - Eletha confronted by Leanna, Kallista+Lumdas knock out Ornsgrym and get the treasure, Theodore dies, mythal activates
    - Still not enough sense of tension, drama, stakes
        - Most exciting part - when they knock out Ornsgrym. Player choice, breaking the rules
    - Still not great at dialogue, giving characters unique personalities + voices, clumsy at descriptions
    - Should have asked how players were feeling, Eletha esp
    - Toby + Bluemoon didn’t really get to do cool things
    - Overall PC actions haven’t really driven plot movement - you plan events (Theodore death, mythal) and the PCs get pulled along
        - Allow them to make more significant choices
        - Should I have let them negotiate with the strigoi?
- 23.9.18 - Strigoia Heist pt 5
    - Fight was kind of anticlimactic - should not have penned in strigoi w ally NPCs
        - could have broken out the dread knights earlier
        - could have pushed harder on NPCs hunting down the culprits
        - could have pushed harder on secondary battle goals (taking down mythal)
    - Railroaded the PCs into working w Vasilev - they could have tried to trick her abt leaving the painting at mansion
    - Could have had Vasilev just fight them + almost kill someone to extort others - instead of having long circuitous discussion
    - Hard to maintain multiple diff chara voices
- 23.10.8 - Bridgetown Brawl pt1
    - Street battle went on for way too long for something that’s supposed to be an intro
        - Map layout - way too big, takes rounds just to engage
        - Naming of enemies between owlbear + harmlesskey needs to be consistent
    - Confounded by fact that PCs were not particularly motivated to go fight
        - Should give them a faster out next time
    - Initial characterization of Luca was bad - not likeable enough
        - came on too heavy on how he only cares about making money, lack of ethics
        - we can salvage by having him return later in adventure, worried abt missing misurium
- 23.10.29 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 2
	- characterization for most NPCs was pretty uninteresting (Ersatz, Sophia, Basta) - seems like you need to think abt them more ahead of time
		- Ersatz is too dumb / lackadaisical, they should have some cunning - we can salvage this as them showing a front. Gotta give them a cool moment later
	- is hard to maintain distinct char voices
	- Bridgetown investigation phase was pretty uninteresting because you didn't have that much planned in depth - because the answer was never in Bridgetown
		- chars didn't have much to say
	- NPCs should ask questions to PCs, have one on one convos for character development
	- they liked the descriptive prose bits
- 23.11.5 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 3
	- Finished fighting merrow, went to tavern and met Clockwork + Merriwink. Toby wants to apprentice under Merriwink or sth. Kallista has fully disguised herself to avoid notice from clockwork. They might want to try and bait the thief with false information. 
	- They thought Ezra's real motivation was extremely funny
	- The thinness of the "investigation" phase shows through - very little info gotten from interrogation
	- Merrow battle was WAY too unbalanced, too difficult, had to cut everyone's HP
- 24.1.21 - Bridgetown Brawl pt 4
	- skill challenge - need to look up the rules for how to actually do this
		- figure out appropriate DCs based on level - I think you should have made them 15
		- Did have some cool/exciting moments - Justine thinking to swing the rope to vault over the net
			- have to get better at dramatic narration
	- the shipwreck "dungeon" was kind of a drag - most rooms were pointless
	- gotta refresh on character voices before the session - you forgot both Sophie + Vasilev
	- description of the fray coming in was not sufficiently dramatic
	- information exposition is unclear - you gotta go into a scene knowing what info the players need to be told
	- clockwork characterization not wacky enough
	-
