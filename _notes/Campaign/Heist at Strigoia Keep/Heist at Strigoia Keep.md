- Description
    
    Beautiful morning, sea spray against your face on the deck of an elegant little skiff. It’s of elven craft, with spells hidden in the scrollwork that have guaranteed your smooth sailing as you go down the coast for the past few days.
    
    Theodore greets them: a rakish satyr with a braided beard. “Good morning my lovelies, are we all bright eyed and bushy tailed for an undertaking fit for only the most foolhardy of outlaws, the most dastardly of criminals? We should be sighting Kevara-Arda within the hour.”
    

- Toby got a call from an old criminal friend in Kevara-Arda - someone has been asking around for a crew to take on a job of a risky nature
- Hand out the map and go over the job
    - Steal a painting from the Duke Ornsgrym’s art collection - landscape of Kevara port by Selleward. Recently acquired by Duke.
    - Theodore: me and Selleward go back, the old fella, we went to prep school in Kevara together. He was a talented artist, but forced into some respectable day job as a merchant’s secretary to pay the bills. Always felt bad for him, and I heard recently that he died - and only after he died did the rich bastards start appreciating his craft! I hate to his life’s work locked up by some ignorant nobles who didn’t even know the guy he was.
    - Strigoia Keep in the countryside just outside Kevara
    - Ornsgrym hosting a ‘diplomatic convention’ of coastal nobles, really an excuse to show off his art collection.
    - Ornsgrym returning to Keep with his new painting on the day of his party — need to do the heist during the party, when security is a bit lower
    - Reward: 1000gp, plus anything else they can carry out the house
    - This is going to be a heist, with a planning stage and a heist stage. You guys need to take notes, review your character abilities and items, and do some thinking. There’s no preset solution to this.
- Go over the map
    - From the finest information brokers money can buy - this should have our asses
    - Strigoia Keep built several hundred years ago to defend against the old Inland Empire
    - Lots of unhinged arcane safeguards, contingency measures to defend against invaders - ancient shit that no one has really been able to fully disable
- Go over the guests
    - Ornsgrym: one of the dukes of Kevara-Arda. Human. Mostly a fool who likes to drink and debauche. Fancies himself an art connoisseur. Married to the Lady Ornsgrym.
    - Vasilev: another duke of Kevara-Arda. Drow. Cunning and ruthless, probably aiming to become the next Patrician. Rumored to have killed his adoptive father to assume dukehood.
    - Sir Shrewseer: elven espiran of the Shrewseer estate, one of the more coastal Mirwood estates.
    - The Court of Birds: apparently sending Owl and Gyrfalcon as their delegates. No one knows the true identities of any of the court.
        - Owl (she/her) is religiously inclined, intelligent and insightful.
        - Gyrfalcon (they/them) is an accomplished duellist.
    - Other minor nobles + attendants of each court
- Theodore gives earpieces - everyone in constant contact, knows what each other is doing

Kevara-Arda - the World’s Gate

- Read out
    
    You all sail down the coast and watch as the tiny fishing hamlets along the sea grow larger and more populated, until Theodore hails you all to look off the prow of the ship, because it’s finally visible: Kevara-Arda, the World’s Gate. You see two colossal statues, built in weathered white stone - a man and a woman (Kevar and Ardan) standing on opposite sides of the strait, their arms outstretched towards each other. You can’t see it from this distance, but you know that the strait is going to be bristling with the masts of ships, docking into port at possibly the largest city and trading hub of the known world.
    
    Sail in under the shadow of Kevara to dock at a jetty. Huge trading galleons coming in from the southward sea, bringing gold and coffee and spices to the north; schooners crossing the strait to trade grain up the river delta; delicate little caravels bringing fine crafts and artistry from Avizalo. Really busy - sailors hauling in and out, dockmasters shouting, the smell of fried fish. You hear WHAAAP the blare of a foghorn and one dockmaster shout - “oh fuck, clear out, clear out - dock 13-theta get clear - there’s a leviathan coming into port—!” and the water mounds and roils, pushing the nearby boats almost sideways as — there’s no other way to describe it — a sea monster surfaces. One giant baleful eye, rows of conical teeth. A bubble on its back shimmers and pops, and from within a band of sahuagins (fish people) and water genasi leap off its back, shouting and laughing as they unload casks of gold and jewels.
    
    Hail a carriage to get through the streets - Kevara-Arda is a city of truly enormous history. It’s seen sheaves of different rulers along its long memory, and its digested all those cultures into itself. It’s a mess of pointed domes and marble fluted facades, old crumbling brickwork, different architectural styles all smashed on top of each other. Thronged with people: well-heeled elves with attendants discussing their latest trade deals, sprawling goblin families stringing out their laundry, blindfolded monks of the Cult of Ignoramus sweep the street.
    

- Set up at an inn on the outskirts of Kevara
- Theodore is getting in as one of the elves’ servant (Leanna)
- Theodore gives them some leads
    - Keep guards go drinking at Rapscallion after 9
    - Kitchen staff are going shopping for the party today at noon, not sure where. (Roll to see how long it takes to find the Fat Wyvern)
    - Addresses of where Vasilev, Court of Birds are staying. Don’t know where the elves are.
- Some time to plan, figure out what information they’re looking for
- Current time: 11am, party starts at 7pm tomorrow

Potential complications

- Shrewseer recognizes Bluemoon - try to enlist to his side
    - if after Theodore murder, try to theorize that Vasilev killed him and he has darker plans
- Vasilev recognizes Lumdas - do it ominously
- Owl recognizes Eletha, Kallista
- Something jams their earpieces
- Guards patrol interior of building too
- Lose parts of their haul as they get away

  

### Lockdown

- Read aloud: You feel - not exactly a sound, but something beyond the range of sound - that makes your ears pop and some quality of the air changes. From the courtyard there’s a grating sound of stone on stone, then an inhuman, ululating scream - then several screams that are very human.

  

- Read Aloud
    
    Background: they were here to steal a painting from Duke Ornsgrym.
    
    You are in Strigoia Keep, a great mansion that was once the last bastion of defense against an invading empire, 800 years ago. Arcane defenses that have long lain dormant have been triggered back into waking, the entire keep bent on destroying anything moving that lies within it.
    
    You’re standing in the great hall, where a gala hosted by the Duke Ornsgrym has been thrown into disarray. An enormous winged creature with a wickedly barbed beak is trying to force itself through the glass windows; behind it is the shattered stone plinth where it once stood as a statue, revived from its petrification by some unknown force. Guards fruitlessly swing at its pebbled hide. Beyond the monster, you see a shimmering gold dome that prevents any passage in or out of the Keep, which arrested Kallista’s attempt at teleporting back to safety.
    
    Around you cluster the nobles in attendance: Duke + Lady Ornsgrym, fretting and sputtering; the emissaries of Avizallo, Owl + Gyrfalcon, standing guard in front of the Duke; the elven lord Shrewseer furiously shouting at Ornsgrym; the Duke Vasilev standing to the side and looking unamused. Notably missing is your employer Theodore, who you just recently found murdered in the adjoining room.
    

- Before we start
    - More thorough recap of what happened
    - Have reset all the combat things on harmlesskey, owlbear
    - Review your items and the map
    - your goal: get out of the keep without attracting attention + with your loot
    - track HP in harmlesskey, then copy over to character sheet when exit initiative
- Owl: sanctuary on Duke O, ask how to disable the defences
    - Lady O: there’s a bypass in the upstairs vault to disable the mythal
- Guards line up to protect nobles, ready action to attack
- Shrewseer: announces his retainer was killed (hold up garotte w fork), probably related to whoever set off mythal
    - Who set off the mythal? Leanna tells him abt Eletha - immediately suspects Moonflower sabotage
    - Threaten Eletha to give the painting or will tell parents
    - Otherwise convince others the PCs are the culprit
- Gyrfalcon: recognizes fork as Vasilev’s. interrogate Vasilev, go to fight
- Vasilev: try to sneak away to hide, maybe figure out what happened to Theodore
- Suspicion on players?
    - Don’t really remember ppls disguises - Lumdas + Kallista dressed as servants, others as performers?
    - Lumdas is still dressed in servants clothes, but he was a performer before
    - Ppl may be surprised at performers/servants being able to fight - pcs roll deception
    - PCs fumbling their loot, someone sees
    - Players get thrown in crypt if found out? then Dread Knights activate
- Dread warriors make it upstairs in 3 rounds - they get warned by the ppl downstairs running up
- Getting out of the keep
    - Have Ornsgrym disable mythal from the vault
        - If no players accompany, takes 3 DC15 rolls to get up there
        - Perception 12 to see if he notices stolen items
    - Entire mythal is anchored to strigoi - taking down strigoi will free the keep (DC14 Arcana to know)
    - Use a spell scroll of dispel magic - need a DC20 arcana check
    - Physical damage to barrier: DC18, HP20, Dmg Threshold 8

  

  

- Strigoi: medieval/arthurian speech. uptight and puritan, hates the new nobles partying. committed to the defense against barbarian enemies. made an oath / enchanted by young Freyot.
    - Summon another 4 stirges when current batch dies
    - Fly down and latch on - take opp attacks as necessary to get back in the air
    - Can telepathically collaborate with stirges to pen in enemies
    - Might run when low enough health - he’s not that committed to his oath
    - Could potentially be commanded by Duke or Lady O, but Duke is an idiot coward
- Stirges: petrified as gargoyles along the pillars. would like a sippy.
- Dread Warriors: mostly mindlessly patrolling the lower levels. Try to get to the upper levels, people will build barricades against.
- Mimics: painted ceramic vases and marble statues, anchored in place. Ambush predators - try to pseudopod grapple then bite anyone who passes
    - DC 14 perception to notice them during battle, when anyone passes thru hallways

  

### Gambit

- Vasilev corners them on their getaway, asks for the PCs to hand over the painting and to come with him
- He was the one who tampered with Theodore’s info - guarantee that the heist went wrong and Vasilev could intervene
- Voicemail from Shrewseer on Theodore’s stone - telling them to pin the blame on PCs, can’t trace things back to the elves
- Leanna killed Theodore, was jealous of Shrewseer’s favor
    - TODO: proof??? or just a confession?
- Threat: reveal their theft to the authorities, Kallista to the iron barristers, Eletha to the Rivershade family
- Still gives them 1000gp for the painting (+300gp from stolen goods)
- Painting was by a disgruntled ex secretary (Selleward) working for one of the big Kevara merchants
    - was trying to smuggle out encryption keys (ask for any info, order any policies on market) > find someone who could tap the rune lines > cause havoc with the merchants
    - found out and assassinated before that happened, their paintings made it into the art market
    - Brush strokes around the border hide salt words that encrypt communication within Giltstern enterprise- communications cover purchases + dealings made by the government, market conditions and predictions, secret trade deals
- Vasilev wants them to work as her retainers
- Show them to Ass Play, tell them about contractor Cinnabar
