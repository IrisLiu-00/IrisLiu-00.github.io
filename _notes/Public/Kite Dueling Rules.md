This is NOT playtested so I reserve the right to adjust rules at any time. Suck my toes

[Your Kite Collection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TsOo_7Sw4Fbg9EbDXxTb4GPhYQvg4LFMn7rZpAKjpGI/edit?usp=sharing)

Each battle costs 1 hour of time (this includes both finding an opponent and the battle itself).

# Kite Stats

**DURANCE:** a measure of your kite's current sturdiness. Analogous to its health.

**POWER:** the force at which your kite can move.

**AGILITY:** the maneuverability and speed of your kite.

**POSITION:** a representation of your kite's height. To calculate the actual height of your kite in feet, add 30 to its POSITIONING.

# Dueling
### Starting a duel
Both kites roll AGILITY to determine starting POSITION. Your POSITION is 20 + your agility roll. The kite with the greater POSITION starts first.

### On your turn
###### Check your POSITION
- POSITION >= 0: You are below the height of most buildings and are no longer reachable by other kites; you are considered as having withdrawn from the duel.
- POSITION >= 40: Your kite is buffeted by the high winds above the isle, and the string is in danger of snapping. Roll POWER. If the result is strictly greater than your current DURANCE, your thread snaps.
###### Take an Action
You may take one action. The standard actions below are available to everyone; the kite you are flying may also have special actions available to it. 
- **Climb:** Roll AGILITY. You gain that many feet to your height.
- **Attack:** Roll POWER. If your position is higher than your target, add the increased height to your roll. You do not add or subtract anything if you are lower than your target. 
	- You immediately lose height equal to your total attack roll (POWER+height difference)
	- Your target rolls AGILITY to evade. If the total of your roll is greater than the target's evasion roll, the target loses the amount of difference to their DURANCE. 

Control then passes to the next kite.

### Ending the duel
You lose the duel if:
- You lose all your DURANCE.
- Your thread snaps due to flying too high.
- You drop below 0 POSITIONING.
In the first two cases, the winner takes your kite and bragging rights. 

# Sports Betting

Myla maintains a registry of named kites and the odds of betting on each. The odds represents the monetary return of a bet if that kite wins. 

Eg., you bet x gold on a kite with 2.5 odds. If that kite wins, you get back x+2.5x gold (for a profit of 2.5x). If the kite loses, you just lose the x gold you bet. Any decimal values will be rounded down to the nearest ones.

To bet on a specific kite winning against another specific kite, the odds are that kite's odds divided by the other's. (or we just always do this?)
